# News Site

This is my first project in the Technigo Bootcamp. The task was to build a Newssite with flexbox. I decided to make the "news" abut cactuses and used a natural backgroung and typical "news-colors" like yellow and red for some of the text.

## The problem

I started by making the skeleton/base of the website, and tried to keep it pretty simple since im a beginner. the problem was to make flexbox work and to make it look clean and not too messy. I didnt manage to make the text beside the pictures look good in all mediasizes, but hopefully i will learn that soon.
