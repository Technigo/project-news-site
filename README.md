# News Site

Assignment was to build a news site with different sections for The Big News and a grid of cards for other news.

The site was also requierd to be responsive and look different on different screens.

## The problem

My biggest issue was understanding grid and flex-box. I started building the webpage before even watching the tutorials on Notion, I was too eager to get going. This resulted in me facing lots of issues I had no clue how to solve.
So, after I structured myself a little bit and realized it might be a good idea to get into some video tutorials first, than everything kinda just floatet. I still don't really grasp grid though.

Another issue I had was that I got too much into the design part and that took lots of time from me.

When solving the problems that occured along the way I mainly used w3schools.com and video tutorials. Both the ones that Technigo posted, and random stuff on youtube.

Next time I will ask for help earlier if I get stuck, otherwise this will soon lead to an heart attack. I will try to use Stack Owerflow more.

If I had more time I would use it to make the other news grid better looking and also it would be fun to try out some JavaScript for "Read more"-buttons and so on.
There's also one issue left on the page to fix, but I just couldn't figure out what was wrong. So I'd fix that as well if I had more time.
