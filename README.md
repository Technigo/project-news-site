# News Site

My first precourse-project at the bootcamp. It is meant to look like a new site.

## The problem

So I tried to figure out flexbox. I got a gist of it, I think. But I really stuggled with centering objects and if I had morde time I would look in to it more, or maby try the grid-technologie to see the difference.

I changed one section just to try also using grid. Also did some changes in the responsiveness, that I had to fix.
