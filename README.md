# The Responsive SKREPPA Magazine Travel Site

### This project was made as part of Technigoâ€™s front-end developer boot camp Fall 2020. 

In this project, I have created a responsive one-page magazine site. The focus was to use **_FLEXBOX_** to create the page layout. The site has a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. 

##  The process and structure
I created a mobile, tablet, and desktop mockup via _Figma_. 

The mobile view is the default. 
The sections were created by using **_FLEXBOX_**.

**Mobile version:**  
Has a 1 column structure and one card on each row. 

**Tablet version:**  
Has 2 cards on each row.

**Desktop version:**  
Has 4 cards on each row.

To create the structure of 1, 2, and 4 cards, **_FLEXBOX_** has the option of _flex-wrap_ and allows for specifying how big, in %, the cards are going to be. For 2 in one row, they are approx 50% and for desktop, they are approx 25%. I have also used **box-sizing** to manage the content dimensions. 

**For each version**
  * There is a header (with logo and navbar), a main news article, and a grid of news articles. The header changes depending on screen size. 
  * The cards are aligned to the center of the page.
  * There is a hover effect showing additional information for the cards.
  * There is an animation effect in the footer.


## How I planed and what would I change if I had more time?
This is my first project as a front-end developer student, so plan vise it was not very planned. I have, however, now learned how I could try to structure the next one. Like:
- Start from the top when coding
- Create a nice skeleton
- HTML first then CSS
- Mobile devices as the default MEDIA QUERIES to start off from 

If I had more time I would have tried to align the content on desktop view better (main and other news section), I would also probably tried to play around more with the animation, and the layout of the navbar.
