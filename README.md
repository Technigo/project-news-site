# News Site

This was a project I did at the Technigo Bootcamp. The task was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The focus was to practise and learn about responsive design and flexbox.

## The problem

At first I struggled with how everything is connected. I didnÂ´t grasp the concept of the box model. Then I got the tip to add a background color to every element, and after that I began to understand. Even though I played Flexbox froggy and other practice games, it was hard to get the elements to do what I wanted.

If I had more time I would work on the styling and tweek how the design would look on the different screen sizes. I would of worked more with the news cards and make them aligned and the same size. Also make the links work and maybe add some more effects, like hover effects.
