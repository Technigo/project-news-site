# News Site

This is a project made when doing the Technigo bootcamp. The project was about to learn how to:
 -structure a webpage  using boxmodel
 -layout a webpage using flexbox
 -create a responsive webpage for mobile, desktop and tablet.


## The problem

I began with a quick scetch of the page. My main problem was keeping focus during coding. New things to check out and try to implement tended to take over. 

Used boxmodel, flexbox, media queries, parallax image and boxshadow transitioning on hover.  

If I had had more time, I would have tried to truncate the paragraph in the main news card. I also tried to take away the card's textbox on laptop view and have it shown over an overlay on hover without rearring the HTML. My guess is Javascript is needed for that, though.

In the best of worlds the cards also would have had an asymmetrical layout using CSS grid.
