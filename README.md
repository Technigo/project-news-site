# News Site

This is a website project in a framework of Technigo Front-end developer bootcamp.
I have chosen New Year celebrations around the world as a theme


## The problem
The website is constructed in HTML and CSS. I have used Flexbox css for layout.
Layout was a problem and final touches such as sticky navigation bar was a bit of a problem.


## View it live
The website is alive on Netlify server
