# News Site

My first html-page with css-stylings. The site was designed to resemble and old pergament paper with contemporary fonts and picture-styles. The page is built with responsive design; one column for mobile, two columns for tablet and four columns for large screens.

## The problem
I made a simple a sketch on a peace of paper and tried to make all the elements act accordingly. I used different containers with different display-properties (eg. grid, flexbox) to alter the elements for the purpose. If I had more time I would resize the images more thoroughly.
