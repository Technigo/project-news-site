First individual project during the Technigo bootcamp.
This project was to learn about layout pages with FLEXBOX.

#Building a News site

This week's project is to create a classic magazine/newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a navbar. Further the site contains a big news section that greets the visitor and while you scroll down on the site you come to the news grid. The site is structured with flexbox and responsive design so the site changes depending on the screen on the device you use for the best user experience!

#The problem

I had some issues with flexbox and got trough the problems by using a guide from the css master Wes Bos. He had a great series called "what the flexbox?".
