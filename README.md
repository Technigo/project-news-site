# News Site
A news site built with HTML and CSS

## The problem

Everything works but when I try to push it to netlify I get this code: 
Page Not Found
Looks like you've followed a broken link or entered a URL that doesn't exist on this site.

I tried different solutions but nothing worked.... but feel free to download the code and check how it looks in the browser!
## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
