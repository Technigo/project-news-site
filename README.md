# News Site

An assignment meant to showcase understanding of HTML and CSS. Site will be responsive to be accessible depending on what device a user would use to view it.

## The problem

I looked around at different news sites and decided to go with something gaming related as that is a big interest of mine. I looked at different layouts and before deciding on my design. Everything was made with HTML & CSS. If I would've had more time I probably would have used something like Bootstrap to simplify and speed up the process.
