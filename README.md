# News Site - Project

I designed this landing page for a small imaginary company to showcase their latest projects and other news. 

## The problem

I started to design the mobile version first. After that, the tablet version and finally, the large website version. I tweaked different versions to find a suitable form for them. For this process, I learned to use Figma.

There were a lot of things I did for the first time. My biggest struggle was with flex/grid boxes, keeping the margins even (despite scaling), and building the hamburger menu for mobile devices. I did my layout on purpose with different elements on top of each other to learn how to code that stuff.

My desktop layout was first with four columns, but because I thought it looked so much better with three columns, I changed that (even though the assignment was to do four columns ðŸ‘€ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‡

If I had more time, I would like to design and code the pages for individual news and other pages.

PS. I need to study this GitHub more. The logic with everything is complicated for me, and when I tried to commit the changes from Visual Studo Code the terminal crashed all the time...
