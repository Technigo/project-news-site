# News Site
This news site has a basic feature of header, navigation bar, main form and a footer. It contains flex box to form a card news. There is a basic hover function included in order to make the cards look shadowed when you click it on the card. It is in a responsive design, which means that it can be looked in three different ways on iphone, ipad and desktop for optimal user experience.

## The problem
It was challenging to understand what is the most efficient way to write the media query. I ended up writing all the codes three times for three media queries, but then I have learned that most of the time it is recommended to write the mobile version first and then add on the changes in ipad and desktop version. Now I am more confident of writing a better and cleaner code for responsive design, as this project gave me a valuable opportunity to understand the hierarchy and orders of media query.
