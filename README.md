News web site:
We were tasked to make a website with responsive design, using both grid and flexbox.

## The problem


-Planing: I started by creating a sketch on Figma to get an idea on how the website should look.
-Approach: first i gather inspiration online, how to make different grids and flexboxes. I started experimenting with different css styles to design different containers. A lot of time was spent on alligning the text, and make everything look good. 
-Techniques: I used primarly flexbox and grid, I used illustrator to create the logo and adjust the size of the images, I asked a lot to chatgpt, google, I read a lot on w3shools, blogs and watched tutorials.
-Future: I would like to go more to detal for example with the buttons's corner rounded, and make everything more harmonious, I also want to be better at pushing my changes to Github
