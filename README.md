# News Site

// So this project is to make a news site or a classic magazine site. My first thought was to make something that I feel kinda passionate about - plants. 
But then it got me thinking if that's a news site? Maybe I can make it into one then! //


## The problem

//So the first thing... How do I want it to look? What do make it about? I know I want somber, light colors. I know I want hover effects over the boxes. I took insperation from the noops code along and a website selling retreats.

So I started to sketch. I wrote down i a simple google docs - what is required of the assignment? 

I struggle af with the display and content on the site. Nothing is working and it feels inpossible to get this done. I have a very clear image in my head of what I want to do, but it is very hard to get there...//

Soo i'm kinda done and it kinda looks like the image I had in my head. 
But now, especially after seing todays demos, I think it looks cheap and not nice at all. I'm not very happy about it. 

I try to remember that I do this to learn and that it is the first project and everything doesn't need to be perfect, but i struggle with the feeling of not being good enough.
