# News Site - Oldflån // Season // Magazine

My first project at Technigo Bootcamp - a news site. 

Project-time: 1 week 

The assingment was to build a responsive "news site" with flexbox.   
I was building a magazine with content from my home area in the north of Sweden - Oldflån. 


It took a while setting up the git clone correctly (it was the first time I forked and cloned in GitHub). 
I used flexbox when I built the structure. It was tricky, but as soon as I got it right with the family relations (parents and children) it was easy to put @media on the elements.

I asked my team (Tigers) and also searching the web and asked in Stack Overflow. 

If I had more time i would build more content (text-boxes) and fokus on the look of the header and footer.
