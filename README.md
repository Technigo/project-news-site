# News Site

This weeks assignment was to build A news site. 
I choose to do one that displays art, travel and exhibitions since that's my current field I and I hade the pictures for it. 


## The problem

This is my first time building a responsive page so I learned about CSS, Flexbox, Grids and media queries.
Deep dived into HTML, CSS and CSS Grids and flexbox, there is SO much that Iâ€™ve learned this last week. 
When a problem arose, I either googled, asked a programer friend or my classmates.
