# News Site

I'll do a website that looks like a new site, like the "newssite-sketch.png". So it should look different depending on which device you use when you're at the website. The site should have a header with a logo, navbar and the site name, in the main content have one big news, cards for other news, both with a title, and at least the big news have som text more than the title. Also hover-effects. And if time som animation, shadows, centering the cards, and more.

## The problem/struggles

Struggles with CSS mostly:
For example a dot on an element like: .h1, when it should be h1, and more details I forgot or did not see, and I started changing the code a lot - nothing happend/changed, and then when I did notice the detail, it was just the detail that made it not work...

FLEXBOX:
Struggled a lot to get the cards appear 2 on one row for tablet-view, 4 on one row for desktop-view. So I did the Flexbox Froggy game, googled and read about it on different websites, I also inspected some websites... Then played around testing, and finally I figured it out, even though I do not understand it totally.


TABLET
How to get the logo in the center was tricky! I tried a lot, doing classes, tried flexbox, order...
I've got help from a classmate and got to see how she did and than applied it to my HTML and CSS with some changes so it worked with my code/design...


GitHub / Git /VS - PROBLEMS: 
I tried a lot and followed the instruction from the live session 
from monday, tried understand and followed the answers in my question 
at Stack Overflow, but nothing worked out with cloning the ssh-key/getting contact between
GitHub and VS, with git-commands in the terminal, etc.
Then a teammate took her time online with me, 
I shared my screen, she had looked things up, 
and we wrote some commands in the VS terminal connecting 
my email and user-name, and more, got access to ssh and so on, 
and then forked all over again, and then cloned with the ssh-key, 
finally also made me get the git status, commit and push commands 
to work. Now I've already changed my code since saturday
and not been able to push my changes until now. So therefore, 
this time, I deleted the orginal HTML- and CSS-files and pasted the 
HTML- and CSS-files I worked in since saturday.

RESPONSIVNESS:
When I changed so it looks good choosing different devices-responsivness
in the browser (like "Ipad Pro", Galaxy S5" it does not look that 
good when just looking at the minimum widht for respective devices...

NAVBAR:
When adding the tag for nav in my HTML code it does not look good.
Do not really know how to deal with it. Guess I need to change
in the CSS, tried some but have not got it to work...

THE MEDIA-CSS FOR MOBILE:
As a teacher said we should not have the @media for mobile, when
designing/coding for mobile first (mobile should be the default). But I first did that and when I
delete the @media for the mobile it completely looks different
and I don't know why...

CLEANING UP & MORE DETAILS
I guess I maybe could clean up more with nothing changing,
but at now I donÂ´t have the knowledge and practice to see it,
I guess with time, more knowledge and practice I understand
the coding more and can clean up more. Of course I could just
test which I've done some, but with time-limit I don't for now.
Some details could also be changed, for example more space to the
left vs right of the links in the header in desktop... so it looks
better. Maybe also do the cards smaller in tablet and desktop...
But I really don't know how...
