# News Site

In this assignment, I was asked to create a news website with a theme of my choice. I chose to make a news site for parents about babies.

## The problem

How I Approached the Problem:

To solve the problem, I started by carefully analyzing the requirements and breaking them down into smaller tasks. I created a simple plan on paper that outlined each step I needed to take, from setting up the basic structure to integrating key features.

Tools and Techniques I Used:

I used HTML and CSS to develop the website. My approach involved using both Grid and Flexbox in CSS to ensure that the site was both user-friendly and responsive. I also used Media Queries and Keyframes to enhance functionality and experiment with animations.

Planning Process:

I began by sketching the layout and features of the site on paper. Once the structure was clear, I moved on to designing the look and planning how to structure the code, with a focus on core functionality first. By continuously testing in VS Code and checking the results in the browser, I was able to improve functionality and refine the design.

What I Would Do Next If I Had More Time:

With more time, I would focus on enhancing the user experience by adding more interactive elements and further refining the design. I would explore the possibility of adding additional features such as slideshows, videos, and more clickable elements. I believe these additions would increase the value of the site.
