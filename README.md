# News Site

This is Technigo Bootcamp project 2. Assignment was to create a responsive newspaper site with header, big news section and other news section. 

## The problem

First I planned the site on paper and then I coded site's basic structure and styled it. I used flexbox and media queries. If I had more time I would have tried CSS grid.
