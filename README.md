# News Site
Assignment: Create a responsive news site using flexbox. 


## The problem
I had difficulties to make my image in section one to be larger than my text when changing device from mobile. 
I solved my problem by shrinking my flex-child in the media query together with flex-grow. 


If I had more time I would have: 
- made my hamburger menu clickable so you could see nav ul in the mobile and tablet devices. 
- give the content more time, now my focus was to get every element in the right place.
