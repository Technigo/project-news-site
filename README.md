# News Site

This is a Technigo Bootcamp week 2 project. The assignment was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site and practise structuring webpages using box model, using flexbox as layout and creating responsive webpages for mobile, desktop and tablet.

I started visualizing the news site both on paper and then on Figma. I spent quite a lot of time browsing on the internet and getting some inspiration. I think the design part was very hard and wasn't sure how much time should I focus on design in the beginning or should I first create the structure of the page. As this is my first bigger project written from scratch, I did a lot of trial and error moves in the beginning and a few times went back to step 1. If I had more time, I would have used the crid and added some animations.
