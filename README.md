# Project News Site
This is my first project at Technigo Bootcamp. The learning objective and end goal was to practise box model, responsive design with media queries and flex box. Later I decided to fetch an open API to get real news on the project from NY times.

The API can load very slow, and at times only showing 2-3 items in the news grid.
