# News Site
A news site built with HTML and CSS

## The problem

Everything works but when I try to push it to netlify I get this code: 
Page Not Found
Looks like you've followed a broken link or entered a URL that doesn't exist on this site.

I tried different solutions but nothing worked.... but feel free to download the code and check how it looks in the browser!
