# News Site

The assignment for this project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site with a big news section and also a section with a grid of cards with other news.

## The problem

The challenge this week was to make the site responsive, that is to write code where the layout and content change depending on if the user visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. 

For this I used a combination of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to get the layout I wanted. I also used the mobile first approach where I created the mobile version first and then add CSS for tablet and desktop. 

I found it very useful to test out my ideas on Codepen - and get a working solution that I could test and verify before I addded any new code to the project. 

In addition to learning how to work with Flexbox and Grid, I also studied how I can make use of transition and scaleX to add hover effects to links and buttons. 

If I had more time - I would have liked to add some more animations to the page.
