# News Site
The assignment was to create a responsive news site using HTML and CSS, as a pre-course for the Technigo bootcamp. The site would be structured using boxmodel with flexbox and/or grid-elements.  

## The problem
I started with reading up on flexbox and grid elements, as well as the basics in HTML and CSS. I studied the course material and googled and youtubed a lot. I also explored the "Inspect" tool in Chrome, which gave me very valuable insights from "the real world". 

I then sketched on the design of the site (using  autodraw.com), but had a pretty clear image in mind of what I wanted it to look like. I also early knew what theme I wanted for the site - women in tech!
It was a good thing that I started early so that I had time to try different approaches, and for all trial and errors! It turned out that I would have to struggle quite a lot with the responsiveness, as the boxes wouldn’t change from 4 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile) column(s) when I used the coding I first had read about. I researched a lot, and then tried a different variant with the code that I found, which turned out to work. After that, I could focus more on the styling and details. I was at this point very happy that I started early, so that I could try several different layouts and designs, and refine the code and styling. At the last minute, I created a design for small screens so that the navbar could be visible. This however I had to create as a media query for small screens, which meant that the code wouldn’t longer be strict mobile first. If I had more time, I would’ve moved around the code (I tried, but I didn’t really nail it). 

I’m happy over finishing the news site being pretty satisfied with the result, and it truly was learning by doing. It is the first site I’ve ever created, and I definiteley feel that there is a lot more to learn and grasp. If I had time, I think I would’ve worked more on and making the site look a bit more ”professional”, and definiteley  experimenting with a grid layout (as I now only used and focused on flexbox). I would also have tried to make the code as ”clean” as possible, as I now suspect there are a few code lines that might not be needed (are of surplus). At this point, everything takes a lot of time for googling, but hopefully I will know more code by heart after a few more projects!
