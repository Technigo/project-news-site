This was my very first project. So fun and also so exhausting. 
The assignment was to make the code responsive (mobile first) and also to try out flexbox. 

My biggest problem was
- To center items on the page.
- To figure out how flexbox worked. Some of the things worked and some did not.
- To ad text on top of the images. With help from Jennie it finally worked.

I tried so many different ways on the way and for my next project I will think through every move more carefully and why things do what they do and also use the inspector tool more so i dont mess up my code with experiments.

What I innitially planned was to make the smaller images have a margin on the sides to make them feel smaller even in mobile but I didnt manage to get that work. The margin was messing up my code in tablet and desktop and the images just wanted to stay on the left. So I decided to let them be 100% instead. I also wanted to do a hover effect on the images but there was not enough time.

STILL! Overall Im happy with the project, it could have been better but it was my first own project and It was a great challenge. Looking forward to learn and understand more.
