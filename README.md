# news-site
Project for week 2 in the frontend bootcamp. I made a site using both flexbox and grid because I wanted to try them both.

It was a bit hard to understand both grid and flexbox but I think the "A complete guide..." pages on CSS Tricks was really good. And also the videos from Technigo. 

I also had some problems with Git because I didn't fork the project from the beginning. I just created a new repo on my Github. So I couldn't do a pull request. But I could copy my code to this new repo. So hope it works. I'm going to do it correcctly from the beginning in the future. :)

Next step for the site would maybe be to fix a navigation for phone.
