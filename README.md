<!-- Brian's Commentary>
This project was about to make a website about something we chose ourselves, for me it was music.

I approached this problem with a paper, I tried to put my "vision" of the website and try to work with it.
I used flex and grid for the html If I had more time i would have played with the styles.
But sadly I didn't exactly arrange the way i wanted to.
