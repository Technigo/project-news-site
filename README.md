# News Site

The task was to create a news site or magazine site using flexbox and/or gridbox, style it and make it responsive across mobile,tablet and desktop.

## The problem
I started using some sort of flexbox layout but realised after a couple of days that I didn't have a very good planning and ide of the layout so I ended up having a very messy code and layout that didnt make sense to me. I istead did a gird layout of the articles which went much easier once I got it set up. I planned by drawing on a paper the rough layout and then I just started coding setting up the header and then the grid elements. 

I struggled quite a lot with managing to get the images responsive. I asked other people and also did a lot of google searching to figure it out. I came a cross a solution that worked in the end, I had to set the images to percentage and also make ut auto; for it to not "bleed" out of its parent element. 

If I had more time I would continue doing a footer and style the header more nicely and give it some more love. I would also want to add some hover effects on the artcle-items.
