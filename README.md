# News Site

This is Technigo Frontend development's week 2 challenge. 

I have selected the strecth goal (black level as per Technigo term) this week.

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  (in this case mobile, tablet and desktop 1440px)
- See the header animation when they load the page
- See the hover effect when they hover over links
- The  <h1> is only visible in the mobile view as it doesn't fit in the tablet and desktop view design

## The problem

THis project is built with: 
- Semantic HTML
- CSS flexbox
- Mobile first development

I found keeping the polaroid effect divs that wrap around the news images hard to set width in the beginning and make the news images stick to their polaroid divs at first so I reviewed several options on how to make images responsive. 
So my solution is to  use the vw unit for both elements. 

I also found the <picture> tag with different sizes of images pre-set in html useful and I will surely explore this option.
