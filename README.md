# News Site

Thee task was to create a responsive news site. It should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I had trouble understanding how to applicate flexbox and grid to my own code. I understand the theoretics behind it but stuggle to see how to use it properly. I ended up sketching with a pen and paper to try and get a good overview of what I actually needed to do. This helped but I still don't think my code is 100% correct.

Next would be to align the sizing of the images.
