# News Site
Coding and styling a responsive site (using media queries) about parrots.

## The problem
I designed a site and scetched it on paper. I then tried my way and failed many times. I atrated over and I found two separate tutorials about the navbar/header and the grid layout. I followed it step by step, googeling what i did not understand and tried my best in puting it all together. I wrote comments in the code along the way so that I would understand what I was doing.

If I had more time I would add a hamburger bar add real target links.

I am having trouble with the deployed site. No images are shown. I have tried to solve it but failed. The site works localy but not on Netlify.
