First project using flexbox to layout the page. The design is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops.


## The problem

I took a moment to draw a sketch before starting any coding. Then, I worked on the HTML skeleton, then CSS. I struggled to layout the page because one div container was missing inside my sections. I have been using a lot the chrome inspector to check my css all along the week.

If I have had more time, I would have added more animations like a real hamburger menu showing up from the top or side, and some underline animations on some links.
