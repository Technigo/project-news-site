The News Site Project

The project for our second week was to produce a responsive news site by using CSS Flexbox, Grid and media queries. 

The planning and problems

I started by sketching on paper and then adding it step by step, taking the easiest part first which was HTML and then going in to the styling. I used both Flexbox and grid. Flexbox for the main news item and Grid for the other news items. 

I think the media queries in combination with using Flexbox and Grid was tricky.  If I had more time I would dig deeper into media queries as well as both Flexbox and Grid and how to combine them all in the best way to make the site even more responsive.
