# News Site

First project is about creating a news or magazine website with responsive design. 

It should contain a header with name of the site, a logo and a navigation bar.

Requierments for the project:
- Containing CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Responsive design (Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column (it should look good on devices from 320px width up to 1600px))
- The site is build with a header, main news article, and a grid of news articles.

## The problem

Trying to use Figma for low fidelity wireframe and try to start building the website as soon as possible.
The biggest struggle was the responsive design and implementing a hamburger menu.
