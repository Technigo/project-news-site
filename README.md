# News Site

The assignment is to create a news site with grid, flexbox and responsive design. 
I chose to create a traveller and tourists magazine, hence the name Travelist magazine. 

## The problem
My main problem was to get the correct sizing of the pictures in the cards. I wanted to use flex but couldn't get it to work so finally I used grid for that part as well.If I had more time I would investigate more in how I can use flex to get it to work.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
