# News Site

This week's project is to create a responsive newspaper site, using Flexbox and Grid. The layout changes depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there whould be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I started with sketching up the site with pen and paper, and drew up a wireframe. I then proceeded with the structure and HTML-code, after which I styled the desktop version. Lastly I added all the styling, content and media queries for tablet and mobile.

If I had more time I would create a hamburger menu as well.
