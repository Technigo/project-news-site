The assignment was to create some sort of a news site using CSS grid and Flexbox. Four news cards on desktop, two cards on tablet, and single card rows on mobile.

I first needed to understand the whole idea of Flexbok and CSS grid. I looked at the examples given on the "Build a news site" project page, I watched several clips on YouTube, and I've had good help from the W3Schools code library. Since then it has been trial and error all the way. 

If I had more time, I would have added a footer, split the main news into two columns in desktop mode, and made nicer buttons.
