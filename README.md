# News Site

I have made a Console Gaming News Site.
It is a responsive design that works differently in terms of layout for Phones, Tablets & Computers.

## The problem

I had problems getting the icon in centre of the links but I was helped out with my teammates. I am having reccuring problem with establishing connection with github.
Alignment of links on the Tablet view has been a problem :(
