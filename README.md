Make a news page and style with grid or flex

## The problem

I found grids challenging when we started up in august, and I still prefer flexbox more. Also now that we work in styled components, I see why this long code was hard to navigate.

Going back to this project I kept all the code in media quieries (both what was needed there and not) as it was a long time ago from when I did the project and it was hard to remember what was what.
