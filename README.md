News Website 

The assignment was about creating a classic news website with a header, nav bar and news articles. The website should also be responsive so it should change depending on what device it is viewed on.

I was creating the website using flexbox to style the website. I did not have any major problems and if I had I searched it on google or stack overflow. If I had more time I would have styled it more.
