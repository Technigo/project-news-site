The assignment is to build a website for a newspaper (included header, logo, navbar, part for big new and below for smaller) responsive for mobil, tablet and desktop.

## The problem
I will start by sketching my layout on a paper to plan grid and flexbox, where to place the navbar and headline followed by color scheme.
If I get stuck I will google and/or ask in stackoverflow.
If I had more time I would make an interactive bottom for subscription..




Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
