# News Site
Build a responsive webpage in form if a newssite. 
 
I choose to make a less traditional news site more tailord to music and and nightlife. 

I didn't want to much text ruining the visual, so the idea was that you'd click on the pictures and then be directed to the next page. 

## The problem

I had some problems with the grid section, making the cards the type of containers I was looking for. 
The grid in itself wasn't to difficult but then making the cards behave as I wanted was trickier. 

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
