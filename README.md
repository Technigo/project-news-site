# News Site

The assignment this week was to create a one pager New's site including a header, a main news article section, and a grid of news articles.

The goal was to work with the box system and use both Flexbox and CSS Grid.

## The problem

I started by looking for inspiration online on other webpages and then sketching my own model on paper. The design part is very new to me and I struggled a lot to just create the picture I wanted.

My next step was to name all the boxes in my boxing systen and then start writing it all down in the HTML file. After some trial and errors when CSS was implemented, I did some adjustments in the HTML file. Made the dividing clearer, added and removed some boxes and then most of it fell easily into place when adjusting the CSS to t he new changes.

The planning was difficult since I didn't know what to expect from myself, not having any prioer experience nor practice with working on computers in general. Everything was new to me and I tried to take it step by step without being overwhelmed.

Only tech I used was ChatGPT to create the Headlines and text for my news. Wish I knew how to implement AI more and in an efficient way. There was just not enough time this time to learn how.

A strategy I used to understand the box system and to see what happened with the boxes when I started using grid and flexbox was to give each box and border a dirrefent colour. That way it as easier to see what was happening and what needed to be done to reach my desired result.

I would like to spend less time on the designing part to focus more on the code, but it has been good for the sake of understanding the boxing system. But If I had more time I would proably spend more on the design to make it look good, make the colours match, look up more font styles etc.
