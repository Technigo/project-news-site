# News Site

My first Site in the bootcamp and the first site to code on my own overall. 

The assigment was to create a news page with a main news section, followed by smaller news cards.
The site has to be responive and work well with mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

1. 

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
