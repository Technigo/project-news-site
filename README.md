# News Site

This is my first project made at the Technigo Bootcamp. Our task was to make a responsive news or magazine site. We were set a few tasks and the brief read as follows:
"This weekâ€™s project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row."

## The problem
I started out by watching the video material on flexbox that we had been given. I've tried it before but had not gotten my head around it yet. I made a rough sketch in Figma. When I felt a bit more confident I started coding. I wanted the images in the grid to be same size. I struggled a bit with that but solved it by making the pictures backgrounds of the divs the belonged to. I'm not sure if this is good practice but it worked in this case. If I would have had more time I would have investigated if there would have been a better way of solving this issue. I found it quite tricky to find the breaking points for the responsive function.
After having solved the tasks we were given I played around with overlays and box-shadows.
The next thing to work on would be setting up the divs containing the images to redirect you to the topic that you've chosen to click on.
