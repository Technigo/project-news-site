# News Site

The assignment is to create a news site containing aheader with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The site should have one big and several minor news section. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four minor news cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row. 

## The problem

It was a bunch, but to mention two: 

1. The tools 
GitHub - I had a hard time saving my changes, and when I was finally done, I wasn't able to do a Pull Request. But, with tons of help from ChatGPT, I managed to make the Pull request, but appearently the README-file went gone, so I'm trying to write a new one. 

2. Hamburger menu - 
Tricky one to fix, so I needed a lot of help from Google and ChatGPT. 

## How did you plan?
I used pen and paper. Wrote all the frames within the website with different colors (Header, Body, Main/Big news section, Other content/Minor news, Footer, etc), and it worked pretty well until I got a bit stressed and mixed a lot of thing up - padding, margin, border here and there, grid or flex, when to use what. I also rewatch the videos a couple of times, which was good. 

## If you had more time, what would be next?
I would go through my code to see what unnecessary CSS code I added in my attempts to fix something broken. I also would rearrange it, it's a bit messy. And I would spend more time on the responsive parts, like the nav bar for tablet.
