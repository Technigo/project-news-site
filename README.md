# News Site

This is my first project creating a news site using Html and Css.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had struggles with the entire project due to starting with the pre-course too late which made me feel stressed about grasping all of the information and learning the concepts of flexbox, grid and responsiveness whilst starting with my news site. Id wish to have started earlier and taking the time to understand the basics of html and css before starting with my project. 

During the making of my news site I ran into so many problems that I have forgotten many of them and If I could start over I would have wanted to write comments and understood git push before hand so that I easily could see what my mistakes were and how I corrected them, I was so occupied with trying to reach the deadline (which I didnt anyway) that I didnt have the time to write comments about what problems I ran into since I ran into them every hour more or less. Even though It's been very tough for me and I maybe didnt get the overall aestethics as I would want it I am satisfied with the fact that I could finish the project and say that I learned alot from the mistakes I did and then solved. When writing code that didn't react the way I intended it to I searched the web for answers and found them mostly in W3school, youtube lessons and on Stack Overflow. 

UNMET REQUIREMENT!:
I struggled for over a week with responsiveness and especially with my navbar which I couldnt get to act responsive, ive tried everything I could possibly find online and asking for help about how to make it responsive in mobile and table view but without success and you will notice it doesnt look good at all when inspecting it. The only way I found I could make it look good in mobile and tablet was by using Java Script but I didnt want to use JS since I felt I didnt understand it and didnt want to copy a code just to make it look good without understanding how it works. Im sorry for that and I will continue trying to fix it.

I'm still focusing on spending as much of my time learning the basics of html, css and responsiveness to catch up and understanding it better.
