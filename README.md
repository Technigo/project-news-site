# News Site

The assignment for this project was to build a responsive news site containing a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar and two news sections, other presenting the main news and the other one as a grid section containing smaller news reports. The site should adapt its content based on whether it is used on mobile, tablet or desktop.

## The problem

I started by making a sketch of the website content and the different structures for different devices. I used both flexbox and grid in building the header, main news section and the smaller news grid.

With more time I would have perfected the styling of the page more.
