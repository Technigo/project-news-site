# âœ¨ The SKIN CUT MAGAZINE âœ¨

Layout of a skincare focused magazine website developed as a project during the Technigo bootcamp.


# Planning & The Problem ðŸ§©

This was my very first project all by myself so there was a lot of concepts that were new to me, i.e. flexboxes and responsive design. I planned it accordinf to the learning objectives: 
- Desktop layout: 4 rows
- Tablet layout: 2 rows 
- Mobile layout: 1 row

With help of course materials and research I now understand responsive design and the usage of flexbox. If I had more time I would have redone the code to make it "mobile first" instead the other way around, that was also something that I learned by doing this project.
