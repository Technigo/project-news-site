# News Site

The goal of this project is to create a news/magazine site that adheres to responsive design principles. This project should also demonstrate competency with CSS Flexbox and Grid. 

## The problem

The first step was to brainstorm a concept for a magazine and then sketch out the basic parts. I looked at several magazine websites for inspiration, but in the end decided to keep my design goals simple, and then expand from there if time permitted. I used ChatGPT often when I got stuck, and it helped me get quick answers to things, like how to create a hover effect, for instance. I also referred back to some of the videos from the course material.
