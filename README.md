# News Site

The assigment is to create a responsive news site/magazine article with a navbar, 1 main aricle that's always at the top on all platforms, and 4 smaller articles that should list 4 in a row on desktop, 2 in a row on tablet and 1 by 1 on a mobile phone.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

How I went about the project: I startet at the top with the navbar and worked my way down to the main news article, then to the smaller articles and lastly, the footer. I like structure nad working on a page as I view it.

I wrote the html and css at the same time, mostly to see if things were working out as I went along. Being my first project it was a steep learning curve with a lot of trial and failure, but I guess thatÂ´s how it is when learning something new.

When I got stuck on something, I left it where I was struggeling and moved on with something else to keep the project movin forward. Sometimes I feel that it's better to skip the issue and come back to it later when the brain has had a break from it. 

Being the first time I've built something like this, the challenges came often. I don't know how many times I've watched the videos from the course, but it's more than a handful! I also found a lot of help online when searching the web and I have a super co-worker who has discussed my project with me many times.

I've used both flexbox and CSS grid, both challenging in their own way. Everytime i see the word "flexbox" I hear that "ding"-noise in the tutorial *lol
