# News Site

This is my first project at Techinigo Bootcamp. The requirement was to create a responsive news site using flex box. 

## The problem

It was very difficualt at first to get a hang of flex box. I re-started the project many times until I could find a design and code that I was somewhat happy with. Next time I would spend more time on the actual sketch and do reseach before starting.
