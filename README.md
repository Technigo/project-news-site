# News Site
I've created The New Forker: https://the-new-forker.netlify.app/, mock-up of The New Yorker magazine. 

Aim of the assignment was to create a responsive news site. The requirements: one larger news section, and a grid of news articles. All cards centered using flexbox. 

## The problem
The main problem was not seeing which parts of the site I was changing. I overcame the issue by:
- drawing a border around all sections and boxes
- using inspector to better see the padding and margins around the boxes
- using inspector to make small changes and test code

>How did you plan? 
I've started by making a brief sketch on paper how I wanted the layout to look like. Then I proceeded by structuring code in HTML and later in CSS for styling, mobile view approach first, followed by tablet and desktop.  

>What technologies did you use? 
- HTML and 
- CSS flexbox to layout the page.

>If you had more time, what would be next?
- I would make titles of articles and the whole cards as links,
- add a video and audio tag to one of the cards, 
- make a hamburger menu with a slide-in navigation bar,
- redoing the same page by using CSS grid and
- re-do the New Forker logo in a higher definition.
