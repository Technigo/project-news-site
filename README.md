# News Site

In this precourse assignment we had to create a responsive news site for mobile, tablet and web. Since I joined the bootcamp last minute, I only had about two days, whereas the majority of the class had 2+ weeks, which made this a little more challenging, but still very fun and interesting.

## The problem

Since I didn't really have the time to plan out and watch all instructions, I messed up a little by designing the web page format first, but after a lot of tweaking, I think I got it to work fairly well.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
