# News Site

The assignment was to create a news website about anything you wanted and I chose to do it on yachting because this is what i have worked with for the past 15 years and is what i am passionate about.
The site has a title, nav bar, main news and four smaller news articles all linked to other sites.


## The problem

I started the project by first drawing up a rough outline on paper and then set about trying to exicute it.
The title and sub title are h1 and h2 based. The nav bar i had to search for to manage and used the w3school exapmle.
I had a lot of trouble with flexbox so first i made the main headline into grid format and left it like that until i had completed the smaller news articles in grid aswell. 
After unsuccessfully trying and failing with flexbox i saught help from my cousin who has been coding for many years to help we with the flexbox.
I used google a lot too to trouble shoot.
If i had more time i would have put a bit more information in each card and probably designed them a little different.
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
