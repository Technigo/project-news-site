# News Site

The assignment was building a responsive news site using flexbox. I chose the subject of the environment and wanted to build a simple, clean site with nice pictures and hiver effects. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started by drawing a simple sketch on paper and building a 'skeleton' in html. I then gathered content such as images and texts/titles and added them. I then started structuring the site accoring to a mobile first structure in css using flexbox. I then used media queries to make the site adaptable to tablet and cpmputer. Then I added fonts, colors, a logo (designed in pixlr.com) and hovering effects. I struggled the most with the responsiveness of the site and making it look good even on the smallest of screens. If I would continue with this project, I would have wanted to try CSS grid to make the site even more responsive, and maybe add a hamburger menu for mobile.
