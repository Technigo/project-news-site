# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

I then sketched on the design of the site (using  autodraw.com), but had a pretty clear image in mind of what I wanted it to look like. I also early knew what theme I wanted for the site - women in tech!
It was a good thing that I started early so that I had time to try different approaches, and for all trial and errors! It turned out that I would have to struggle quite a lot with the responsiveness, as the boxes wouldn’t change from 4 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile) column(s) when I used the coding I first had read about. I researched a lot, and then tried a different variant with the code that I found, which turned out to work fairly good. After that, I could focus more on the styling and details. I was at this point very happy that I started early, so that I could try several different layouts and designs, and refine the code and styling. At the last minute, I created a design for small screens so that the navbar could be visible. This however I had to create as a media query for small screens, which meant that the code would no longer be strict mobile first. If I had more time, I would’ve moved around the code (I tried, but I didn’t really nail it). At the very end, I chose to the change one of the flexbox sections to grid layout, because I wasn't really satisfied with how it looked with flexbox. 

I’m happy over finishing the news site being pretty satisfied with the result, and it truly was learning by doing. It is the first site I’ve ever created, and I definiteley feel that there is a lot more to learn and grasp. If I had time, I think I would’ve worked more on and making the site look a bit more ”professional”, and definiteley  experimenting more with the grid layout. I would also have tried to make the code as ”clean” as possible, as I now suspect there are a few code lines that might not be needed (are of surplus). At this point, everything takes a lot of time for googling, but hopefully I will know more code by heart after a few more projects!
