This is a project made during the Technigo bootcamp. The task was to create a responsive webpage while learning to use flexbox.

## The problem
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out a bit early and directly went in to designing the desktop version, very soon going in to css and margins, fonts etc. A paused the project a bit and waited for the coding sessions. Thereafter I really realized my mistakes in starting to design for desktop and also going in to too much details too soon. So I did not plan enough. I did not start over, but I had to put a lot of time in to reverting the design and also structuting the code afterwards. 

Lesson learned! For my next project I will for sure take more time to plan and be careful not going in to detail too soon. I used the technologies that were the scope and requirements for the project. I primarily used Technigo's information sources. For next project I think I will also try to do more research before I start to make sure I understand the concept before just starting to code because I am eager to start. If I had more time I would love to develop the design even more, more details, pictures, hover effects etc!
