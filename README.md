# News Site
Project-news-site was my first coding project, and a part of my Technigo pre-course. The assignment was to create a news site about whichever subject, and make it responsive.

## The problem
A big part of the project was to learn how and when to use Flexbox and CSS grid. Since this was the first time facing these techniques, I had a bit of a hard time figuring out when to use Flexbox and when to use Grid. Looking back at it (and for the future) I would have chosen Grid to a greater extent than I did. It turned out I had to work for a while to realize that. From what I understand, Grid would have allowed me to steer the layout more. I used Grid for the Big news-section and it turned out looking better than the section below. For example, in the last section I was not able to make the button stay at "the bottom" of the container, since their position was relative to the text above.
