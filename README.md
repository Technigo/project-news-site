# News Site

The task was to build a one pager news-site.

## The problem

The challenge was to apply the correct method (flexbox or css grid?) to make the website look and behave the way I wanted. For solving this issue I watched the pre-recorded instructions and asked AI what was wrong with my code when I did not get the desired outcome.
