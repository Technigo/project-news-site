# News Site

This is a responsive news site in HTML and CSS. 
This is the first individual Technigo project.


## The problem

I started to state mandatory features and brainstorm ideas for the site. I choose a concept and continued to sketch wireframe for mobile and desktop using inspiration from the web. 

I picked a color palett that fited the theme IÂ´ve chosen for the news site.

I used Figma to do a prototype of the site.  

When I started to code i coded for mobile first and then tablet and desktop. 

My intention was to structure the css file in a logical way but next time I will see if there is another way to structure the code better. 

If I had more time I would use some JavaScript to add som functionality for the navigation bar.
