# News Site

Elephant News Media

My news site is inspired by Refinery29
I wanted it to be clean and easy to use.

## The problem

I had difficulties with flexbox and spent some good amount of time on getting everything responsiv. 

Flex-box: overal issues: I used flex tool, image object-fit and media queries to solve it.

Footer: It wasn't attched to the bottom and wasn't responsive, I used media queries and position, top, padding and width slove it.

Planning:

I sketched my website on a paper first and created a backlog. 

Next time:

More time planinng the code and features I want to use. I had already used up a lot of time doing things and then removed, so maybe look over what I did wrong. Focus on the main things first and then a new features.
