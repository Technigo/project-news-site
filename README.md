# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site that was responsive when using different screen sizes. 

## The problem

I started with planning a rough outline and the content. Tried to follow a code along provided by Technigo. I googled a lot and looked at the tips from my team on slack. I got tangled when using the code along since I didn't understand the basics so I started again. If I had more time I would add more media querys to make the transitioning of the page nicer and also tweak the site. It is far from perfect.
