# News Site 📰 🌍

This is a news site inspired by trap music performed by female artists. None of the artists are real. 
The main goal in this project was getting familiar with HTML and CSS tools to make a website look nice and be responsive.



## The problem
I struggled with the responsive part, as I had never coded a responsive website before. I solved the problem with the articles by using grid. that seemed to work much better on a container with many cards. For the header picture container I used flexbox.

## Technology used
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
