# News Site
Create a news site with header, main news article, grid of news articles using CSS grid and flexbox to layout the page.
Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

## The problem
How did you plan?
I started with the header and worked my way down to the footer, taking one part of the site at a time until moving on to the next. I struggled the most with the layout for the "big news article" to get the picture and text side-by-side in the center.

What technologies did you use?
I watched the videos on notion first and when I didn't find the answer in the videos I googled, googled again and googled some more.. A lot to be found on youtube, examples displayed on codepen and step-by-steps on https://www.w3schools.com/.

If you had more time, what would be next?
Have more "fun" with the grid, explore effects that could be added with CSS.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
