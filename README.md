# News Site

The assignment for this project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site with a big news sections and also a section with a grid of cards with other news.

## The problem

The challenge this week was to make the site responsive and where the layout and content change depending on if the user visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. 

For this I used a combination of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to get the layout I wanted. 

I found it very useful to test out my ideas on Codepen - and get a working solution that I could test and verify before I addded any new code to the project. 

In addition to learning how to work with Flexbox and Grid, I also studied how one can make use of transition and scaleX to add hover effects to links and buttons. 

If I had more time - I would like to add some more animations to the page.
