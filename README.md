# News Site - Love is Blind Nation
 

The assignment was to build a news site and use all the tools within html and css that we have learned so far.

## The problem

This first challenge was really scary and hard. I wanted to work with a fun and easy going subject to be able to see the joy in what I am learning. I made a basic sketch and started with the boxes, one thing at a time. I went back a lot of time to our school material to understand how to use the tools and my very best friend was ChatGPT, that I got a lot of help and explanation from. On the q & a I learned to use mobile device as basic starting point and to always make all of the boxes as a template for all coming projects. This I didn´t do this time. However, I have learned SO much just in this first project! Honestly, I've sweated, talked to myself, laughed, cried, and behaved manic these couple of days. If I had more time I would work even more in the details to make everyting better, nicer and prettier. One thing I didn´t find a solution for, was to make the pictures on the last row in the same size. I hope to learn how to do this for future projects.
