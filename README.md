Since this is an educational assignment, I focused on learning and having fun. 

After a short attempt to plan my website beforhand, I decided I needed to be reading and writing simultaneously, re-doing and re-planing as I went. Knowing this is not the most efficant way of working, I came to the conclusion that trying things out and having an agile approach made me learn the most.

I read the Technigo lessions but have also googled a lot (of course) and inspected other sites. I looked at a lot of news sites.

The main layout is created using grid, while the content is aligned with flexbox. I found that using named grid areas worked well for this project - although I am not sure it holds up the same on larger/more complex sites.

Since I had a lot of time, I stretch the requirements - mainly to try out things I wanted to learn. Having more time and knowledge, I would have used more js. For example, I wanted to arrange the 'Most read' based on clicks, and the 'Latest' based on dates. Also, I saw that others don't really use 'onClick' to open the menu, so I want to know how that works.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
