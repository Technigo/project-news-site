# News Site

In this precourse assignment we had to create a responsive news site for mobile, tablet and web. Since I joined the bootcamp last minute, I only had about two days, whereas the majority of the class had 2+ weeks, which made this a little more challenging, but still very fun and interesting.

## The problem

Since I didn't really have the time to plan out and watch all instructions, I messed up a little by designing the web page format first, but after a lot of tweaking, I think I got it to work fairly well. I however realized when deploying the site, that a lot of things looked odd on different medias, on an Android, a lot of text was bigger than it should, and on iPad, the footer bar completely disappeared. This wasn't however visible in the preview in Chrome, so it took a lot of tries trying to get it right in all different mediums. 

I also had some issues with getting the Git push to work, so I just uploaded the files directly to GitHub this time since I wanted to be done in time.
