The assignment is to learn and use HTML and CSS to create a website with specific requirements on layout and responsiveness. 

## The problem
In order to decide what I was going to build I used Figma to draw out sketches from desktop to mobile sizes. These became the guidelines to build upon aswell as where I based the content on (like the pictures, menu icon and how much text I should use). 

Then I started to add all the elements that I could see reflected in the sketches like the navbar, main article and small articles. When everything was added in HTML I linked my HTML to a CSS where I added colors, fonts, widths and sizes to everything. I messed up by going desktop first, so I had to make some smaller changes to everything before I started to work on the layout.

To place everything where I wanted to I used the flexbox approach since it's similar to what I'm used to working in Figma with auto layout. While it was some translation over to flexbox, it still worked very similar. With some back and forwards from the CSS to the browser I managed to do something resembling my sketches and the requirements from the task.

If I would redo this task I would want to try out a different visual appearance aswell as working with values that would make the design close to the sketches or vice verse, since precentages doesn't represent exactly what I had in mind.
