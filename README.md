News and information about mental wellbeing. 
I was inspired by my healthcare background. 

## The problem

HTML and CSS.
I made the layout by CSS grid and Flex as well as Media Queries for different screen size. 
During the project, main problem was that I realized unclear concept of CSS, for example how to apply grid and flex? How to collabrate grid and flex? What kind of situation I need to use Media Queries? 
I draw the layout and made plan on paper as the instruction mentioned. Read previous students' project, read their code in order to learn. Then I back to read materials again. It helped me to understand deeply. 
I tried to write the code by myself. When I was confused about Flex-direction, I tried all the possibility to see what would happen. I also post questions on stack overflow. Learned how to ask questions. 
If I had more time, I would test my code of resposive design more. Practice more different layout by grid and flex. Also I would  read more code of different website, this helped me a lot. 
For HTML, if I had more time, I would try more different way to make buttons more interesting as well as navbar.
