# News Site

The first individual project during the Technigo frontend bootcamp, creating a responsive news site using flexbox layout. 

## The problem

After reading the brief I started with the overall plan for the project. Using the knowledge from the course material I started coding, mapping out the different sections in html. I found the Noops Clone-video to be especially helpful and used it for my main inspiration when structuring both the html and CSS-files. Since the assignment is centered around using flexbox, that is the main model I used when styling the different elements.

If I had more time I would probably try and add some hovering effects to the different images and links included. I would also like to look into the different ways of cropping and adjusting images. A third thing would be to look into using CSS-grid, we used it during the first project and I found it to be a bit more intuitive than using flexbox.
