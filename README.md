# News Site

I created a magazine site for hiking, with some of the trips I made and one that I plan to do. 
The site is responsive and have different layouts in mobile, tablet and desktop versions. 

## The problem

I had a idea how I wanted the site to look but it got a bit to complicated so I had to start over. 
In the begining I tried to do everything at the same time, which got messy, so I planed my codeing more the second round. 
The site is more or less just flexbox and some css styling. I got some hover effects to get shadows to all articles.
I also used a greyscale filter on the Big news img, to make it grayscaled as default and colored while hover.  

If I had more time I would do some more design codeing in the small news. The images there are differnet sizes and I would probably do some overflow:hidden do scale those as I did with the logo.
