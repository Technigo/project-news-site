# News Site

This is a travel related newsite.

## The problem

I planed the design based on the project brief.
The project is built in html and css.
It has been made responsive by applying the mobile first approach.
For positioning and layout I have used flexbox and grid.

Future ideas:
This project could be extended with a json file to store the news data in there and with javascript it could be mapped through.
The navbar could have a dropdown under News that could list different categories.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
