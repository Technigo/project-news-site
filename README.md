# The Globetrotter ðŸŒŽ

This is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to learn how to structure webpages using boxmodel, layout webpages with flexbox, creating responsive web pages for mobile, desktop and tablet, by creating a classic magazine or newspaper site.

The Globetrotter is a template of a travel news site that features travel news and inspiration. The inspiration for the website's design comes from travel and fashion news sites, such as cntraveler.com, lonelyplanet.com and highsnobiety.com. Therefore, most of the written content is also borrowed from these sites. 

## The problem ðŸ’¡

- Prior to creating the news site, I drew a scetch of how I would like the site to look like by using google jamboard. 
- The code was written in VS Code and in pararell I tested and viewed the site in the google chrome browser by using the inspect tool. 
- The site was structured in to 6 parts: header, newsletter subscription, big news section, main news section, travel inspo section and a footer. 
- When building the site, I used flexbox in order to structure and achieve a responsive design. For example, on desktop sized screens, the main news section is stuctured in to four columns, for tablet sized in two columns and for mobile sized in one column. 
- I  used different hovering effects, such as shadowing, underlining text and opacity. I also created a small css-animation for the newsletter subscription text next to the button.    
- After deploying the news site I tested it on several browsers, such as google chrome, safari and firefox. I also tested the newssite on different devices with different devtools in google chrome and safari. 
- If I had more time, I would have cleaned my css code more. I would also have worked more with the stucture of the website and less with the graphic design (colors, pictures and fonts). Additonally, I would have started with a mobile first approach instead of the computer first, which I ended up changing.
