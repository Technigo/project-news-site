# News Site
This project was done during week 2 in Technigo bootcamp. The task was to create a news site and I chose to make a tribute to my hometown, a guide page with content that I myself would like to see if I visited Ã–rebro as a tourist.  

## The problem
When I first started, I did not have a complete idea of what my page would look like. I was more focused on a typical news site, with the New York Times as a model. But I made an overly complex layout and had trouble getting the page content to end up where it should. I got the idea to do the guiding page instead so I started over, even though I did not really have time.

I have googled a lot during the project, watched videos and used code games to understand flexbox better.

I tried to plan the project and thought it would take less time than it did. However, some extra work due to colleagues on vacation, a trip to Stockholm and a broken arm came in between. And I also find it easy to get caught up in the details. That's probably something I have to work on.

If I had had time I would have aimed for black belt with some animations and CSS-grid.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
