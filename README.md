# News Site Project

This was the first project of the Technigo boot camp, and the aim was to learn about creating responsive page layouts using flexbox.
The project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar, which changes depending on if you visit from a mobile, tablet or desktop.  The site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I used mobile first design and then added media queries to style tablet and desktop. I added flexboxes to layout the page and to help make it responsive. I also created a hamburger icon using three div tags for mobile and tablet view.
I included box-shadow to create a polaroid effect for my "other news" articles, and added a simple CSS animation using keyframes to move the cards when hovering over them. I also added a fav icon.
If I had more time I would look into making my hamburger item fully operational. So that the menu appears when you click on the icon. I would also move my h3 text inside the article tag and play around with the styling.

## View it live

The fictional magazine site I created was called "Art Matters!" and can be viewed using the link below.
I have tested the site on iPhone, iPad and desktop as well as using the developer tool in Google Chrome. 
All platforms are working as required.
