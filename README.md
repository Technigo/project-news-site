Here I've made a website about the TV series Twin Peaks as a assignment for Technigo bootcamp week 2.
The goal was to practice with box model, flex-box and responsive design.

## The problem

I struggled with targeting elements that are inside anchor tags in CSS. I didn't know how to select different elements in CSS.
I also struggled with margin (or padding?) between elements in responsive design. I wanted fixed margins between rows of containers but they behaved differently than I expected; e.g. images overlapping each other, images overlapping text, the size of the container in the last row being way bigger than the others.
