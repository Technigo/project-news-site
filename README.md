# News Site

Week 2 - News Site Project

Assignment: Create a responsive design with three different views (desktop, tablet and mobile). The site should have a header, a main news article and a grid of news articles.

## The problem

I used a combination of grid and flexbox. If I hade more time I would fix the positioning of the image and the text in the big news section, especially in the tablet view.
