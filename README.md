# News Site

This is the first individual project from Technigo's boot camp, the news site project. The task was to create a responsive website using flexbox. The site was to include a header, navbar, a big image with text and a grid with smaller news cards.

## The problem
I started by making a structure in HTML and then I planned on how I wanted to style each part of the website in CSS. The site is made mobile first.
The layout of the page is made with flexbox. 
If I had more time I would have come up with some hover effects for the news card and added some to the big news as well.
