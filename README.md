# News Site

News site on nordic minimalistic interior design.

## The problem

I used all sorts of resources to get a grip of the main html and css structure. 

I started off the project by drawing a simple design for mobile device and then scaled the design to tablet and desktop. 
I created the html structure first, then I added styling to assure that the site responded as I expected. 
After that I kept on adding styling, including images and icons. 

I will continue to add a section for news letter subscription and a section to connect through social media.
