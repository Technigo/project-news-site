# News Site

Build a responsive newssite using flexbox layout and media queries.

## The problem

I started to sketch out the layout of my page and figured out what sort of newssite i wanted it to be. I read up on flexbox, boxmodel and media queries. 

If I had more time I would have wanted to add animation, more complex hovering, a newsletter form and do the footer more stylish.
