# News Site

This is Technigo Frontend development's week 2 challenge.

I have selected the strecth goal (black level as per Technigo term) this week and added an animation.
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See the header animation when they load the page
- See the hover effect when hovering over links and social media icons

## The problem

THis project is built with: 
- Semantic HTML
- CSS flexbox
- Mobile first development

I found keeping the polaroid effect divs that wrap around the news images hard to set width in the beginning and make the news images stick to their polaroid divs.

I reviewed the fundamentals of each display and each element's default values and managed to fix this.
