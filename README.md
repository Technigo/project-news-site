This project is part of Technigo Web Development Bootcamp, sprint 1 week 2, where we are supposed to build a responsive website
that should change depending on if you visit it with a mobile, tablet or desktop.

It has been rough but educational to. 


## The problem

I had problems with understanding the very basics of HTML and CSS, how grid & flexbox work and how to handle rules for parent/child. 

For my next project, I will spend more time planning the project.
