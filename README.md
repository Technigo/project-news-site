# News Site

A news-site; made to practice responsive design, flexbox and grid in CSS.

## The problem

I started designing everything for the computer, when I really should have gone mobile-first. That was probably the biggest insight I got from this project!

I fought a bit with CSS, especially image sizes, and positioning, but with some trial-and-error and copious use of "Inspect Element" I got it figured out.

I need to learn more about naming conventions and get better at the @media rule. I also constantly thought I was either making it too simple, or too advanced, lol.

## What I would have liked to done better

The pictures I used were just some pictures I randomly took from Wikipedia and they are not uniform in size - 150x150 is a good compromise but some of them look a little bit weird resized.

The hover effect looks kinda cool but as you can see it messes a little bit with the size and positioning of the content. However, it looked Good Enough(tm) so I kept it.
