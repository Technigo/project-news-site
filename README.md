# News Site

The task was to create a news site with some requirements;
A responsive site with a header containing the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. Further, the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I did mobile first and change the style depening on width of the screen.
I used www.w3schools.com a lot apart from the tutorials Technigo provides.

If I had more time I would have med forms for log in, clickable links and a working mobile menu as well as look into css animations.
