# News Site
The assignment was to create a responsive one-page news site. The site had to include a header with a logo and a navbar, a big news section, a grid of smaller news cards, and have some kind of hover effects. 

## The problem
I decided to focus on making a responsive grid before putting too much energy on design and content, and general layout sketches were included in the project material. I picked Flexbox as my main tool for positioning in order to learn more about it. I studied the responsiveness a real news page and replicated it to the best of my ability. The mobile view was the most challenging because compared to the desktop and tablet view, which were set at a fixed width, I wanted it to display at a set percentage of the screen without images getting distorted. If I have had a bit more time I would definitely have added a toggle menu to the mobile view.
