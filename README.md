# News Site
Project made for Technigo - Front end bootcamp 2020 

Built a responsive webpage in form if a newssite. 
The project was to:
- Structure webpages using boxmodel
- Layout webpages using flexbox
- Create responsive webpages for mobile, desktop and tablet

I didn't want to much text ruining the visual, so the idea was that you'd click on the pictures and then be directed to the next page.
