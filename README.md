# News Site

I have created a small site for Hearthstone players (card game) where they can find easy decks to play with.

## The problem

I went through most of the documentation and help for week 2.
I used the provided sketch as a basis for my site
I started with the HTML to get a good basis with header, main section, sub section and footer
I worked on the flexbox which was a bit of a challenge because I have not worked that much with CSS (height, width)
Styling is very basic but added some background color, images, free logo, hover effect and linking to another site that focus on popular hearthstone decks (hsreplay.net)
