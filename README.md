# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

I created a magazine site about chocolate, containing a header (with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar), a big news section and a section for other news. I made the site responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
