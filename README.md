# News Site

News site on nordic minimalistic interior design.

## The problem

I used all sorts of resources to get a grip of the main html and css structure. 

I started off the project by drawing a simple design for mobile device and then scaled the design to tablet and desktop. 
I created the html structure first, then I added styling to assure that the site responded as I expected. 
After that I kept on adding styling, including images and icons. 

I will continue to add a section for news letter subscription and a section to connect through social media.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
