# News Site

<!-- Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point. -->

This website features a navigation bar, a main content area with a featured section and news cards and a foot, as well as, a responsive design with media queries for different screen size. And the content revolve around a ficional "Fish News"theme, presenting articles and images related to aquatic life.

## The problem

<!-- Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next? -->

For this assignment, I chose VScode as my code editor and used HTML and CSS to build the structure and the appearance, and Codepen to test my ideas before I started to code for the assignment, as well as Adobe Color to check the readability of the content. I also used ChatGPT to generate some interesting texts for the website content, detect potential bugs and search up solutions to my questions.

To be more specific, firstly, I used HTML for structuring the content of the webpage, and break down the project into components(header, navigation bar, featured section, news cards, footer and animaiton section). 

Secondly, I applied CSS for styling and layout. For example, I used CSS grid for the layout of the main content and news cards, and used CSS flexbox for the other detailed contents.Then I inclued FontAwesome for icons and implemented CSS animations for creating a underwater feeling in the background. After that, I used media queries to ensure the webiste's responsiveness on various screen sizes. 

Finally, I pushed the whole project to Github and deploied it on Netlify.
