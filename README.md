# News Site

The assignment was to create a classic news site with a responsive design. 



## The problem
The problem i had was the content not aligning the way i intended them to. I then started from scratch and managed to solve it by placing the content in divs. I started out by just using flexbox, but then decided to try and make a copy with both flexbox and grid. The mixed layout looked better, so decided to use that code instead.
