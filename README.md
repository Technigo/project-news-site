This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp. 
The objective was to learn about boxmodel, flexbox and responsive design. 

# News Site

The assignment was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. In addition to containing a header with name, logo and navbar; a "big news section" and a grid of cards, the site should also be responsive and the layout should change when looking at the site from a desktop screen, tablet or mobile.    

## The problem

I started by making a sketch of the site with a design of the grids on the different device-sizes. I used flexbox to align the "news cards". I first tried using 'px' to determine the size of the cards, but decided to change to '%' to make it easier and a more fluid design.

If I had more time I would, in the mobile size, make the text for the "big news" in a smaller "box" that can be folded out when pressed a button (so it doesn't take up so much space of the screen). I would also make a smaller header that sticks when you scroll down.
