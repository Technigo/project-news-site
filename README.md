# News Site

I simply decided to make a news site with fake news cause I love the humour of it. With more focus on trying to learn from, and understand, the assignment requirements than on putting a lot of design effort in it. 

## The problem

I have no experience in coding so this was challenging for me, to say the least. Learning from scratch, I had to try over and over again, and get comfortable with learning from many mistakes. I started a layout in figma but since I have never done any coding before, I figured this time it was easier for me to just dive in and focus on one task. 

After a while I started to see how CSS works with all its features and it's amazing! If i had more time, I'd get into the design part more, and also stretch my limits a bit, like adding a news ticker and animations. I look so much forward to learn more.
