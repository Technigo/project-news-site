# News Site
This website is my first within Technigos boot camp for Web developers. It is done in the so called "pre course", which has been taken place before the "real" course starts. With help from pre recorded videos (and google!) I have, like the task said, created a very basic website, where I have used both CSS Grid and Flexbox to put things in the right order. I have also used media queries to make the website responsive.

## The problem

Since I am completely new to this, I have had some issues with placing some elements exactly where I would have wanted them. I also know that my code probably is a bit hard to follow, or that it is named in a way that probably could have been better. Hopefully I will get the hang of those things as the real course starts.
