# News Site

First week assigment for Technigo BootCamp. The assigment is to make a responsive news site for mobile, tablet and desktop.


## The problem

I went mobile first and then tablet and desktop. Started by making the cards and news and moved on to navigation. This is made with HTML and CSS, using both flexbox and CSS grid.
