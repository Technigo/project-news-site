# News Site
I chose to pay tribute to my hometown, a guide page with content that I myself would like to see if I visited Ã–rebro as a tourist.  

## The problem
When I first started, I had no set idea of how my side would look like, I was more focused on a typical news page, and the New York Times as an example. However, I made a too complex layout and had trouble getting the page content to end up where it should. I got the idea to make the guide page instead and then started again, even though I didn't really have time.

I have googled a lot during the project, watched videos and used code games to understand flexbox better.

I tried to plan the project and thought it would take less time than it did. However, some extra work, a trip to Stockholm and a broken arm came in between. And I also find it easy to get caught up in the details. That's probably something I have to work on.

If I had had time I would have aimed for black belt with some animations and CSS-grid.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
