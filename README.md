# News Site

This project is about creating magazine or newspaper site. Site changes depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. It contains big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there is four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there is one card on each row.

## The problem

I used flexbox for the layout with media queries to make the responsive design. I used also some animation with hover effects to make images zoom out and change the angle.
