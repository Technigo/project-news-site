## The problem

With last weeks assignemnt och resent lecture as a raminder I started by trying to deside on a layout or design for my project. I went to www.fokus.se
and www.caminomagasin.se for inspiration and regarded these two as the framework for my design.

The resources and techniques where provided by Technigo (and of course google) now it was just a metter of putting it all together on my own site.
