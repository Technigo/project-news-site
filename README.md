# News Site

This was an assignment from the pre-course at the Technigo Web Dev bootcamp (Spring 2023).
The aim was to create a responsive news site, using only HTML and CSS.

## The problem

I started out by brainstorming ideas for the content of my news-site on a piece of paper. 
Then, in order to get inspiration for the layout, I was looking at previous news-sites created by Technigo alumni.
The Web Inspector tool has been a great tool for understanding the CSS Box model and Flexbox/CSS Grid.
Then I roughly sketched out what I wanted my layout to look like in Figma.

I started building, using the old-fashioned approach of trial and error and the knowledge I had accumulated from studying the pre-course material, Mimo (the app) and from my own research on the web. 

The first big mistake I made was to deploy my news-site to Netlify way too early in the building process. I was excited to see what it would look like on my phone, and most of the other students were deploying their sites at this point. But this mistake put a stick in my wheel very early on, as my browser soon showed the error message "SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN" when I would try to open the index.html file to see my progress. I freaked out and must've tried a hundred different solutions proposed to me in various threads all over the internet, including StackOverflow, Netlify's own forum's, etc. I obviousy wasn't the only one who had experienced this problem... I even bought two domains in panic, one from Netlify and one from Loopia, thinking that would be a quick fix to my problem. It wasn't.

In the end I realised that the only thing that would work would be to start anew. So I deleted my Netlify site and my repository on Github, I reinstalled Git, re-forked the project from the master branch and re-cloned it into a new folder on my desktop. I created a new html file and a new stylesheet and dropped as good as everything from my previous files.

From this point onwards, I was feeling very stressed because the dead-line was approaching and I had nothing to show. But once I had a blank slate, I found that the code pretty much just flowed out of me. Not as fast as one would hope, but little by little I built the mobile design and watched with satisfaction as it grew. 

Long story short: The problem mentioned above has taken a lot of energy from the actual building of the site. Since I couldn't manage to open my html file for days on end without receiving that error message, my work-flow has constantly been interrupted by moments of frustration and feeling very powerless. This is a normal part of being a beginner. You make mistakes and you fix them. But to my regret, as a result of all this, I can't say that I've met all the requirements for the task. 

As you will see if you click the link below to my news-site, I have built it Mobile First as recommended, but I have not come any further than that. The designs for tablet and desktop are still missing. I will continue working on this project by filling out the media queries for tablet and desktop, but for now I wanted to have something to show for myself.

I have learned many things: About "the art of the trade" of coding, such as knowing when to apply Flexbox & CSS Grid, but also about everything around the practice of coding, such as time management and handling emotions of stress caused by being under a lot of time pressure. I don't work very well under pressure, but I did my best and I am proud of what I've managed to do in such a short amount of time while starting completely from scratch. I've also learnt to go easy on myself when things aren't going very well. It's been a rough start, but I am very motivated to continue learning & growing as a person!

Thanks for reading!
