# News Site

This is a website about plants! I created a few articles with common things that I myself have googled the past few months.

## The problem

I faced many problems, since I have never made a responsive website before. The precourse material, as well as internet articles and Youtube videos helped me a lot. If I had more time, I would continue to work on the responsiveness so that the columns fit perfectly with every screen. Since I was short on time due to me still working full-time, as well as facing a few problems with Git since I updated my computer, I unfortunately had limited time to actually work on my code to make the site look axactly the way I wanted it to. However, I did learn a lot of new techniques!
