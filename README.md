# Arctic News Site

A responsive news site using Flexbox layout.

## The problem

I have quite a lot of experience working with Flexbox and responsive websites in general, so this assignment was a lot repetition to me â€“ which was great. I have reviewed every little detail that I thought felt clear to me, and tried to find new and better solutions to approach the issues that comes up with a responsive layout.

I made a wireframe sketch to plan the layout of the page. I tried to make small variations in the header depending on the screen size/device. I also tried to build it flexible so that I would need to write as less media querys as possible.

If I had more time I would probably make a better solution with the links in the article grid. The hover effect could target the whole card to be more visible and accessible.
