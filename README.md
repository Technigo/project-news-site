News Site
A website that provides tips on movie / TV series - for a perfect movie night!

Task:
Create a responsive page with a user-friendly interface on computer / tablet / phone.

Solution / problem
To make the page responsive, I used the grid and flexbox. 
Grid to create layout and flexbox for smaller elements. 
If I were to redo my project, I would read more about responsive design + "position: fixed".
I use "position: fixed" on my navbar and I had problem to get it to respond to the width of the site.
