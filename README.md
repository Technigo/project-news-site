# News Site
With this assignment Im to create a responsive news-site. The goal is to make it beautiful and functional for both phone, tablet and desktop view. 

## The problem
I started with watching a lot of videos and re-reading material on specifically flexbox. I used VS code to practice and implement different flexbox attributes to understand the possibilities. I thought the "basic-layout" that Technigo provided had a really good wide use feel so I went for this layout as my responsive design. I used firefox devtools mostly for checking up if my code worked on different viewports and with live share in VS code I was able to make minor changes and reach my goal efficiently. 

If I would do this again I would start with also planing on which content I will be using because I realized that content still plays a part in the overall finished product. Other than that Im proud of my first work, first commits and deployment!
