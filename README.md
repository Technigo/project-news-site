This is a project made during the Technigo bootcamp. The main task was to create a responsive webpage with one big article and a grid section with smaller articles. The tools/techniques used for this project was HTML, CSS (flexbox, responsiveness) and Javascript.

## The problem
First I did a small sketch of how I wanted the page to look like. Since this was my first real project I was very excited to get going. My mistake was that I started with the desktop version, and also went into the details of the design too soon. I did not start over, but I had to put a lot of time in to reverting the design and also structuring the code afterwards.

Lesson learned! For my next project I will take more time to plan and be careful not going in to detail too soon. For next project I think I will also try to do more research before I start to make sure I understand the concept before just starting to code because I am eager to start. If I had more time I would love to develop the design even more, more details, pictures, hover effects etc! It would also have been fun to try out CSS-grid.
