# News Site

This is my solution for project 2 in the Technigo Bootcamp. 

The assignment is to build a responsive magazine or newspaper site. Besides from the news-sections the site also is required to have a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The appearance of the site should also change depending on if the visitor uses a smartphone, tablet or desktop computer. 

## The problem

The task was to create a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. The rows for the cards change depending if the site is visited from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. 

I started the assignment by doing some brainstorming on what topic I wanted on my site. After deciding to do a site about coffee I researched images and decided on what colors I wanted to use.
I had a pretty clear vision of what I wanted the page to look like, so I took some time doing research on how to use CSS grids for my cards in the news-section. I've used flexbox for the navigation and CSS-grids for the news-section.
