This is a project made during my second week at the Technigo bootcamp.
The learning objective was to create a responsive landingpage for mobile, desktop and tablet using box model and flexbox to structure and layout the page.

# News Site
The theme for the project was some kind of news site, I chose to create a fictive magazine named Knitty News containing articles related to knitting. The content itself was not of outmost importance since the focus was to create the responsive layout. But content is fun and I think it's easier to work with the layout when you have a set design specified so I started my project by creating a logo together with a color scheme and picked suitable images.

## The problem
The assignment was quite instructive so the structure for the layout were already set from the beginning. We also knew that flexbox were to be used so that's where I started. At first I worked with the skeleton of the page by writing html in VS code. When I had the basic structure done I began to style it with css in a separate file. To get a responsive design I used the developer tools in chrome a lot, I got the breakpoints I used in the mediaqueries from there for example. There was a lot of trial and errors to solve problems along the way. If I had more time I would definitley try to shrink the code a bit if possible. I did for instance repeat myself at some places but couldn't find a way to work around it fast enough so that's what I would focus on next.
