# News Site

The assignment is to create a news site with grid, flexbox and responsive design. 
I chose to create a traveller and tourists magazine, hence the name Travelist magazine. 

## The problem
My main problem was to get the correct sizing of the pictures in the cards. I wanted to use flex but couldn't get it to work so finally I used grid for that part as well. If I had more time I would investigate more in how I can use flex to get it to work.
