News Site
The task was to create a classic news webpage using 
flexbox and grid(if you wanted to). The page should
 be responsive to desktop, tablet and mobile.

The Probelm
I went through all the course material and started 
sketching up my news page on Miro. However, the design 
grew with the project! Then I started, with the help of 
a grid, to build up the website with many boxes that 
grew and decreased the larger or smaller page I had up. 
In the boxes I put in the title, picture and text and 
with the help of flexbox I structured the inside of all 
the boxes. By googling, youtube videos and going through 
the course material several times, I solved problems such as,
 how to get 4 columns when the screen is largest and 1 column 
 when the screen is smallest. On the website I have used 
 JavaScript, keyframes, hover, animate, flexbox, grid, ect.
  If I had had more time, I would have wanted to put in a search
   box that was large and visible on desktop and tablet but only 
   a symbol in mobile. And so I would have liked to enter dates, 
   clocks and degrees that are in real time.
