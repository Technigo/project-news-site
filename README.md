The assignment was to create a website that was responsive when changing devices. The images and layour should follow the different sizes and not make teh reader scroll unecessarily. 

## The problem

I approached the problem with the attitude that I would learn as much as possible about flexbox. Even though I achieved this I wish I would have laid more groundwork on the design of the page beforehand. I often got lost in the parent and children relationships when I didn't have a clear structure beforehand of which divs where dependant on each other and when I didn't know how I needed to structure the webstie. 

If I had more time I would have worked on a hamburger-bar and footer. I got stuck on layout and would have liked to have tried moe different things outside flexbox.
