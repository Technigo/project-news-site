# News Site

Hello! This is my fist ever assignment by myself at Technigos frontend developer bootcamp. :D

This week's assignment was creating a news one pager website. Which included a header with nav links, a big news section and a small news section. the smaller news section would be in one row on mobile, two on tablet and four on desktop.

## The problem

Since this was my first assignment I had to ask for help and google a lot. i was an avid visitor of stackoverflow and asked my classmates several questions.

If I would have more time I think i would have done the smaller news section with grid so i could more easily decide 1-4 layout btween differnet devices. I would also like to style it more making it look better.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
