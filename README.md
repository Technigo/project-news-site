# News Site

This is a project from Technigo's boot camp, the news site project. The task was to create a responsive website using flexbox. The site was to include a header, navbar, a big image with text and a grid with smaller news cards. The pirate theme of the news site comes from the pirate lorem ipsum.

## The problem
I started by making a structure in HTML and then I planned on how I wanted to style each part of the website in CSS. I made the website mobile first. 
I had some troubles with justify-content not working when align-items did but I changed around the margins and widths and it worked. 
If i had more time I would have come up with some cool hover effects for the news card and added some to the big news as well. I tried around with making the image zoomed in when hovering which I would also like to have done. I would also clean up my css a bit, I think there are some repetitions that coudl be removed.
