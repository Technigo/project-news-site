# News Site

The goal of the project was to create a responsive newspaper site using flexbox and grid.

## The problem

Since I attended the course very late I only had 4 days for it. I had no chance of watching all of the study content and read up on everything I had missed if I'm going to leave it on deadline. 

Therefor I had to prioritize the function of the site, even though I know there are a lot to improve both when it comes to both the structure of the code and the look. I am also aware there might be instructions I have missed. But I will make my best to be able to watch it all before school starts.
