# News Site

This weekâ€™s project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. The site should be responsive.

## The problem

I used flex for creating the layout of the site. I think I planned it out pretty well timewise. If I had had more time I would have done more with the animation-part and also a bit more styling.
