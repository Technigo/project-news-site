# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

"The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row."

Blue:
- Style your page.
- Use flexbox to layout the page.
- Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.
- The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.
- Play around with hover effects, i.e. change colors, add or remove borders or flip the image upside down.

Red:
- Add a box shadow to make the photos look like polaroids
- Align the cards to the center of the page

Black:
- Add some animations on your project
- Another solution to dealing with a photo collection like this would be to use CSS-grid. [Here](https://www.notion.so/technigo/CSS-grid-95523a2144a3460db7b4e7a2084260d8)'s a short video on how to get started, and [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)'s a complete guide.
