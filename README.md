# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site. I've created a news website about a music production software creating music synthesizer plug-ins and named it "Magic Synth".

## The problem

When I approached problems I used a combination of methods to try to solve them. I went through the material on disco, used google, chatgpt and the inspector. After many trials and errors I kept moving forward. I tried to do a sketch by pen and paper first but for me it was easier to get the hang of it by going startight into coding. With the new knowledge I have now I think it would be great to plan before I start to code next time. If I had more time I would develop the website more and change some styling elements.
