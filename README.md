# News Site

The aim of the project was to create a responsive webpage for mobile, tablet or desktop. For the project I made a classic magazine or newspaper site containing a header, logo, navbar, big news section and a grid of cards with other news.

## The problem

For the project I structured the webpage using boxmodel and used flexbox for the layout. The page is built mobile first, which then changes depending on screen size using media quaries. For the design I played around with different hover effects and box shadows to make the page more interactive for the user. If I had more time, I would focus more on how to size different-sized pictures to become equally big.
