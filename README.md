# News Site

This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp. 
Focus was learn about layouts using flexbox and the task was to create a news site. 


## The problem

In todays news it's alot of focus on what is going wrong in the world. And it's sprinkled with commercials saying you are not good enough. On my news site we focus on news that is making the world more equal. With stories about women, by women. 

I did not plan this project well. I started playing with my design before reading the material. I wanted to see how much i could do with my previous skills and the result of that is that i've spent unnecessary time on changing my code to responsive in the end. 


I used flexbox for layout and unsplash.com for free pictures. I have an animated donation button that "clicks" down when you click it. I also have hovering effects that change color and sizes. Also some box shadow on my small news. 

If i had more time (and knowledge) i would like to set a rotation on the daily quotes so that it changes from day to day. I would also add google fonts to change my header font-family.
