# News Site

This is my news site, inspired by the Pirate Lorem Ipsum. The task was to create a responsive website using flexbox. 

## The problem

I started by making a structure in HTML and then I planned on how I wanted to style each part of the website in CSS. I made the website mobile first. 
I had some troubles with justify-content not working when align-items did but I changed around the margins and withs and it worked. 
If i had more time I would have come up with some coole hover effects for the news card and added some to the big news as well. I tried around with making the image zoomed in when hovering but I didn't succeed, it looked too ugly. I tried making the h1 staying inline and not line-break, it worked for a while then I messed it up somwhow.
