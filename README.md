# News Site

Assignment from Technigo bootcamp. Includes creating a basic webpage which is responsive and had different designs for mobile, desktop and tablet. 

## The problem

I started with the basic layout of the page, I used flexbox to do so. I made a simple sketch to create an overview of the finished page. If I had more time to work on the page I would like to add some more animations (and some more fun pictures)
