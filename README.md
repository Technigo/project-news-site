## Project 1: News Site

This project is a news website that delivers good news daily. One of my very first projects:)
The main focus of the project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper responsive site using flexbox.

## The process

I visualized my website in 3 resolutions(mobile,tablet,desktop) in Jamboard.

In order to arrange and align elements on the page like navbar,big news section and news gallery I used flexbox.

For responsive design I chose mobile first approach and then added media queries to specify layouts for tablet and desktop.


## Challenges to solve

1. Images in the gallery resize differently. I've tried to add flex-basis:250px to the item and flex: 1 1 0, which
   is supposed to tell the browser that all flex items should start out with 0 width. Both options didn't work.
2. Reorder links and the logo in navbar for tablet version.
3. Put video instead of the large photo in the Big News session.
4. Improving hover effect on the images. I want the text to appear when i hover over the images, not over a differenr part of the text.
