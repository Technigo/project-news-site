This is a project made when doing the Technigo bootcamp. The project was about to learn how to:
 -structure a webpage  using boxmodel
 -layout a webpage using flexbox
 -create a responsive webpage for mobile, desktop and tablet.


## The problem

I began with a quick scetch of the page. My plan was to code mobile first. 
I wanted to try to not define the width of the box-items.. 

Used boxmodel, flexbox, CSS, media queries, javascript for toggle button. Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. 

How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
