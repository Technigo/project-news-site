# News Site
This weekâ€™s project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The focus was to practice what we've learned about responsive design and flexbox. On desktop sized screens, there has to be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, it just has to be one card on each row.

I made a news site called 'Wedding Weekly'.

# The problem
This is the first time ever building a site like this with view for desktop, tablet and mobile. I found it difficult to know what inspector to use - live server, responsive design in Safari and Chrome all showed me different things. In the end I went with how it looked like on Netlify. I had some other problems along the way as well, figuring out how to place my navbar links on different sides of the header for example. All problems that occured I solved by simply trying different solutions o n my own, with Google, Stack Overflow and/or with help from team mates. 

# What I learned
I've learnt more about Flexbox and about how other different inputs in the code work. Even if there are several things I wish I could improve, I'm proud of what I've accomplished on my first solo project.
