# News Site

This is a simple website, built in VSC. The theme of the webiste is dedicated to the digital design. Styling of the webiste is kept in a minimalistic way to match the main theme. 

Both flex box and css grid were used. 

Simple and abstract images are made by me. 

## The problem

Layout's sketch was made in Figma. During the development of the project, the final outcome changed the form and is slightly different from the sketch - this is because of testing the website's utility. 

Website was built first for the mobile usage, and later on for tablet and desktop. This helped with making the web fully responsive.
