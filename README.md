# Cuppa News - News Site

This is a short webpage using specific CSS tools like Flexbox and CSS Grid.

## The problem

I began by drafting mobile, tablet, and desktop options on Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/3ore34o4CWskiMoIzm3i0M/News-Site-Project?node-id=0%3A1&t=VjDrGNYDjQSs3l6a-1).  I then started by including brief HTML content for each section of the website.  Once this was completed, I started to style each section.  Styling the header was the most challenging as it was the first section I approached.  I then styled the Big News section and the main Other News section.  I also included a brief footer at the end. At the end of organizing the layout (flex or grid) for each section and was happy with functionality, then I fixed the colors, fonts, spacing, etc. If I had more time, I would continue to work on the footer and overall appearance of the page.  I would also continue to try and understand how to move elements around within the Grid and Flexbox structures.
