# News Site

The assignment was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site, with responsive design and that contained a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. 

## The problem
I started to sketch out the three different layouts on paper, the basic structures but no layout. I then wrote the basic structure in HTML, with semantic tags like articles and sections. I started adding some CSS but then realized I didnt start with mobile first so started over again. I used flex-box to design the layot of the page, and practiced different ways of styling the boxes. I had some difficulties with sizing the images to fit the text and be responsive since I had added a tag that made the images cover the whole box and overwrote the text no matter what I did. I then removed the tag and could continue to style as I learnt to during the class on box-model and I  also realizied I could delete som of the classes since they where going to be styled in the same way, so that was a big moment! If I had more time I would possibly have added a footer and worked more on the text-styling.
