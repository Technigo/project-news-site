# Weather App
This is a pre-course project for Technigo bootcamp. I build this site out of my love for Berlin.
The data is static and no api used.

## The problem

The problem was design. I wanted to make this to represente Berlin. So I decided to use raindow color, and tried to make it pop and fun, like Berlin.
I explore many designs and CSS propaties, and in the end I am quite happy about how this looks like.
