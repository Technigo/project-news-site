# Project-news-site - Technigo week 2 - buil a responsive webpages

Technigo Remote Frontend Boot Camp. Our task was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site that should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The site should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.
## Work 
The sketch was made in Canva and then  the different modules were interpreted in code. 
The site is built on html and css.
## Result 
The site is very basic and the mobile view is the best way to look at it.
