# News Site

This is my first project in the Technigo Bootcamp Fall 2020.

The purpose was to create a classic magazine/newspaper site with focus on the 3 main topics of this week: boxmodel, flexbox and responsive design.
I chose to build a webpage about a dog rescue center, using the news section as a picture gallery for dogs in need of an adoption.

## The problem

I decided to stick to the sketch provided by Technigo (see newssite-sketch.png)because I found it difficult to skiss a different layout without obmitting any requirement from the blue level.

I applied the "mobile first" approach, using different mobile queries for tablet and desktop versions. 
I used the flexbox technique in the big news and other news sections and the CSS-grid technique in the header.
I added a hover effect to the images on the cards and a box shadow to all images and a "beating heart" animation. I aligned the cards to the center of the page.

I struggled with absolutely EVERYTHING! Time plan, flexbox, responsiveness, CSS-grid...
Every step was new and requires tons of googling so I started with coding a bit too late. It took me a long time to make the flexbox work as intended in desktop version. I could not make the navigation bar responsive in the way I wanted with flexbox so I switched to CSS-grid for that element :-)

I have tested my web page with good results in Chrome, Edge, on iPhone XR and on iPad Pro. Unfortunately, it does not look good at all in Internet Explorer; I tried to solve that issue by adding alternative CSS codes but it almost broke my initial solution so I went back to my previous code.

If I had more time, I would try to remove the site name from the header in tablet version, make the web page compatible in Internet Explorer and add a hover effect that flips the cards to reveal additional information about the dog on the picture.
