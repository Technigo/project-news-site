# News Site

Assignment: Create a classic magazine or newspaper site with header, logo, navbar with a big news section and grids of other news using flexbox and grid.

Displaying 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on tablets and 4 on desktop with set breakpoints.

## The problem

I planned in Figma.

I used a combination of grid and flexbox. I wanted a hamburger menu without using JS so I looked at different non-JS solutions and tweaked them.

The issues I had were, for example:
- Understanding flex and grid
- Keep aspect ratio of images when resizing them
- Navbar behaviour on different screen sizes
- Hamburger menu behaviour

I googled, read on stack overflow, read on mdn web documents and watched youtube videos for different ways to solve issues.

If I had more time I would:
- Use JS for a working hamburger menu. I realize CSS is not the best solution for this. Right now it's more of a placeholder.
- Tinker with logo in the middle of navigation on tablet, I have a feeling there must be a better solution than I have now.
- Make the font size variable.
- Fix thre resizing of the big news image on tablet, not happy with how it looks right now.
