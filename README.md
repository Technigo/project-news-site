# News Site

The project this week is building a news site.
My news site is gonna be about Fasnacht - The Swiss Carnival.

## The problem

The steps I took to build the news site:
Paint a wire frame of the whole project on paper.
Start with building everything in HTML. 
Use Flexbox in the Navigation bar
Use CSS Grid for building the site
Use Media Queries for making the design responsive while working mobile first
Style everything in CSS and link the file in the HTML Head
