# News Site
The project brief:

Create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

I did a fashion and a lifetsyle magazine site. The focus was responsivesness and use of flexbox to structure different sections.


## The problem

First I made a sketch of the site for mobile, tablet and desktop that I wanted to create on Miro.com . Then I created a logo using Tailor Brands. I collected images for the project in Unsplash. I did a mobile first approach in coding. I used the inspecter tool in Chrome to see the actual width of the page and adjusted my images and boxes using flex-box, trial & error method and playing with margins, width of the sections, images to acheive one column on mobile, two for tablet and four for desktop. I used media queries to make the site responsive. I went back and forth with Youtube video tutorials, Google and my code to get the flexboxes to align differently according to screen width. 

If I had more time I would have done a clickable hamburger menu for mobile that when clicked shows the menu. I would have also made a photo gallery section using grid and anchor the menu links Beauty, Fashion, Lifestyle and About us to this gallery section, made a navbar that sticks at the top when scrolling and make some of the images look like polariod pictures using box-shadows and probably some kind of animation.
