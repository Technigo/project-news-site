# News Site

This is a project for the pre course for Technigo. The brief was to build a news site with a nav bar, a main article, and a general news section with responsive code. 
My site is a art new site, with focus on art made by women. 

## The problem

I find it hard to know where to start sometimes. At first I just struggled a lot with getting pretty simple things to work. Then I realised I just needed to focus on content of every segment first, then fixing the css for just that segment. 

I had trouble with the hamburger menu, I made it using a checkbox, which I initially couldn't figure out how to hide. 
The problem was I hadn't given it a class, because I had not realised what the . meant! I stuggled a bit with the responsive layout too, one problem I had was I hade put an */ in and nothing around it was green. I had a friend help me look at the code, and he taught me a simple method of checking where in a document something's wrong (just testing code in different sections of the document to see where it's working). Seems like an obvious method now :) 

I would probably want to do more animations! And adding more details to the site, like authors to the articles etc. 
My background is in graphic design, so I'd love to properly design a website, getting nice lines and a bit of a better flow. And fix the hamburger menu fold down thing, seems too small? add more pages?
