# News Site

Created a blockchain news site. 

Had to create a newssite  using a layout with CSS flex / CSS grid. 

I had to choose which CSS approach to use. I ended up using both flex and grid. Uploaded some pictures through css, added some animation effects and made it responive into a responsive wed design. I would have invested more in the footer effect and it's placements.

Tools used in this project: Github, The terminal, Netlify and VS code.
