# News Site

This was the first project of the Technigo boot camp, and the aim was to learn about creating responsive page layouts using flexbox.
The project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar, which changes depending on if you visit from a mobile, tablet or desktop.  The site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I used mobile first design and then added media queries to style tablet and desktop. I added flexboxes to layout the page and to help make it responsive. I also created a hamburger icon using three div tags.
I included box-shadow to create a polaroid effect for my "other news" articles, and added a simple CSS animation using keyframes to move the cards when hovering over them.
If I had more time I would look into making my hamburger item fully operational. So that the menu appears when you click on the icon.


## View it live

The fictional magazine site I created was called "Art Matters!" and can be viewed using the link below.
I have tested the site on iPhone, iPad and desktop as well as using the developer tool in Google Chrome. 
All platforms are working as required.
