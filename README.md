# News Site

The assignment was to create a magazine or newspaper site using responsive design, css grid and css flexbox.

## The problem

I decided to create a site for an imaginary magazine and focus on code/layout and put the content/text aside.

I found working with grid and flexbox to be relatively straightforward, especially after watching/reading the course material. 

My approach was quite playful - trying out different ways to use flexbox, grid, box model and responsive design in the inspector (which I also used to troubleshoot any problem). I believe I learned a lot about how to use css.

I started by creating a version for mobile, including a very simple hamburger nav (which surely needs more work, but I decided to focus on the other elements instead). Then I moved on to tablet and desktop.

My biggest struggle was the responsive design, to make the design (margins and sizes) work in different viewports and correlate with each other.

If I had more time I would try to write a cleaner code and try to work with class selectors more efficiently. I would also improve my hamburger menu and put some more effort into the content.
