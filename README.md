# News Site
(Technigo coding boot camp)
This weekâ€™s project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site, to practice what we've learned about responsive design and flexbox. On desktop sized screens, there has to be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, it just has to be one card on each row.

# What I learned
I've learnt more about Flexbox and about how other different inputs in the code work. Even if there are several things I wish I could improve, I'm proud of what I've accomplished on my first solo project.
