# News Site
The assignment was to improve the accesibility on one of our previous projects. I chose to work on my news site project. 

## The problem
For me everything went quite smooth this week apart from the images. I researched about formats, compression and changing the sizes. Lighthouse kept flagging that one of my images could be even smaller after I had re-sized it and changed to the format I wanted which made me a bit confused. I used squoosh to change format and sizes but I felt like sometimes it compromised on the quality of the images which made it look blurry on the site. I think it looks okay now but I've spent a lot of time on that this week. Since I wanted to use the inspector and watch my changes on the deployed site, I've done a lot of commits which might look a bit messy on github.
