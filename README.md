# Architecture Magazine Site

My first task was to create a responsive news site in the Technigo Front-end Developer Bootcamp. Main focus was to learn how to layout web pages using Grid and Flexbox and create responsive webpage for different sized devices.

## The structure

There are four cards in a row on desktop sized screens, two in a row on tablets and, on mobile there is just one card on each row.

The structure contains; • a header (with logo, name and navbar) which looks different on different screen size, a big news article, and grids for other news articles. • news cards which aligned to the center of the page. • hover effect for both the links and the cards. • a subscription button with an animation effect in the footer.

What I learned and what would I change if I had more time?

This was my first individual project, so I learned a lot of new concepts like flexbox, grid and “mobile first” approach. If I had more time, I would probably try to simplify the codes.
