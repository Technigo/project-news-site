# News Site

This is an assignment where we get to practice using the box model, flexbox and to make the site responsive.In the end I also added a grid. 

## The problem

I read the material and watched the videos that was in Canvas this week.I did al lot of experimenting to understand how flexbox works. I Would have worked ore with the photos and animations if I had time. Also get the hamburger menu to work.
 Next time I will plan more in detail how the site looks like, so I have a clear picture of it before I start coding.
