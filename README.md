# News Site

The assingment was to create a magazine or newspaper web page that could adapt do both mobile and table size. It was supposed to have different size news and use CSS grid or flexbox in it's design. 

## The problem

I started the project by planning it on paper and deciding it's theme. When I started coding, I got too excited and stopped following the initial plan. That led to a great mess in both code and web page. I then decided to start again, following the plan and using the mobile first approach. I reused parts of the previous code and was able to create a cleaner code and more pleasing looking web page.
