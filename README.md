# News Site

Making a responsive news site with flexbox using HTML and CSS for different outlets.

## The problem

Made a plan on working my from the top to the bottom and fill out with content as I go. Kept the mantra "function over styling" and did my best with the making sure the worked like I wanted it to. 

Using flexbox for the first time and learning all the elements in getting itmes aligned and re-sized depending on the media outlet became my biggest struggle. Tried Google, asking classmates and using the inspector tool to reach the classes and sections of the parent and children in flexbox. Either the images became tiny or the paragragh overwrote another element and so on. 
Started with the parents and putting borders over them so I could see them change when styling the children. Put children in section and wanted the headline on top, with a small paragraph in the middle and an image in the bottom of the news card.

This worked fine until I tried to center all these element inside the children - 'cause I couldn't reach them no matter how I tried with CSS. Therefore I made an ugly solution with padding pushing the content to the center. Still unsure why I couldn't make it work but I think I made it look good under the circumstances. Hey, rollercoster ride!

Continued with a sidebar menu on the top of the site that looks different in every media outlet and a logo next to it. Plus followed through with an idea I had early on about a sign up for newletter at the bottom - and it turned out exactly like I imagnied! 

So I stuck to the plan - from top to bottom, filled with content as I continuedon and added some smaller functions.
Wanted the headlines of the news articles to be linked and put actual news articles from other sites there. The paragraph and link are italic when hover and images opaque. Input and botton with some shadow effect and the site title will glow up a bit.

Styled the phone site light and fresh - whereas the other outlets were filled out with color. The borders will slim down as the screen shrinks and the images will take up more space.

I think the winning concept was to keep the styling minimal when trying to get the functions working and then adding on a specific style that can work from small to big screen. Starting the think about a type of reader and what would fit those who would visit this kind of site.
'Til next time I will play around with grid, espacially for the computer and learning how to fill such a large canvas with content in a nice way.
