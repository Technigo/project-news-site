This project, of a news website, was made as a Week 2 project for Technigo bootcamp. The aim of this project was to learn how to create responsive webpage for mobile, desktop and tablet, how to structure webpages using box model and layout page using Flexbox.

## The problem

The chanllange for me was to combine responsive design and layout, for everything to look alligned and centered. I achieved the allignment I wanted by using Flexbox. If I had more time I would have improved the design of the page.
