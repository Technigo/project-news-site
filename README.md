## The problem

I started to make a sketch of how I wanted it to looka like, using pen and paper. A lot of going through basics using mainy google, a lot of tutorials on youotube and the material given. We talked a lot inthe team and helped eachother out. If I had more time a would have made a "hamburgermenu" showing in mobile, I tried in the beginning but got stuck. And I also would hade added more content to play around with grid. And a footer.
