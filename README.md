# News Site

The project was to build a responsive magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar.

## The problem

I started by sketching up a desktop, tablet and mobile version of the site. After that I went ahead with creating a framework with html, after which I created the mobile version with CSS. When I was happy with looks of that version, I made the tablet and desktop versions using media queries. Flexbox was used in the big news part of the site, and CSS grid in the grid part with other articles.

Lastly I added a box between the big news part and the grid part, and a footer, just to make the site a little bit more easy on the eye.
