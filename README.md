# News Site

The project for this week was to build a news site. The site has to contain a header with a name, a logo and a navigation bar. It also has to contain a main news section and a grid of cards with other news. The site were supposed to be responsive, to work with mobile, iPad and computers. There were also requirements for the grid to change depending on the screen size. 

## The problem

Since we were supposed to get familiar with flexbox, I started to catch up on this, and usd flexbox method for header, main news and footer. For the remaining news section I decided to try using grid instead of flexbox. I haven't used it before, but actually found it easier to work with than flexbox. The flexbox method however, is great to use when you want to adapt a navigation bar to the screen size, and I decided that a row was best to use for full screen size, while a column looked better on a smaller screen. It is very easy to adjust the direction with flexbox method which makes it useful.
Regarding the responsiveness, I worked with media queries to solve this and to adjust the images not to look weird on any screen size. I first found this a bit difficult, but discovered that it was better to work with % than px for at least one of the width and height. 
I did put hover effects on the links, to make them change color when hovering, which I found nicer than just ordinary links. 
I have also experimented a bit with shadow box, which I find really interesting. I did choose not to make the images look like polaroids, but to make them stand out on the site a bit. 
If I had more time to put on this project, I would work on the navigation bar, and either make it a hamburger menu or add some other effect to it. I would also experiment a bit with ordering items in a flex container.
