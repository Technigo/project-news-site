# News Site

This is an assignment from the pre-course at Technigo web development bootcamp. The aim was to create a responsive news site, using only HTML and CSS. 

## The problem

I began by sketching out an overall layout of how I roughly wanted the design to look in Figma. Then I scrolled around other sites for inspiration and watched a lot of YouTube tutorials outside of the class material. I used the old-fashioned approach of trial and error, breaking it down into smaller problems until I got it right and incorporated it into the main code. Chrome inspector was a big help in understanding the impact of certain properties.

Since this is my first time using CSS grid and flexbox, I thought it was easier for me to design the website for desktop applications first, and get all the content where I wanted it, and then adapt it to tablet and mobile devices. I built the overall layout with CSS grid and used flexbox for some of the content. In the beginning, I found flexbox to be really challenging compared to grid, since it felt like a much more “loose cannon” and not as easy to control. Now, I’ve come around to really like it.

If I had more time and could redo it, I would have designed it mobile-first, to get familiarized with that approach of coding. One of the biggest challenges for me was getting the pictures to look alright for all screen sizes, so I would dive in to that topic a bit more also.
