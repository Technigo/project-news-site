# News Site

Create a News Site using flexbox to layout the page. Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

## The problem

Overall i think i started out the way that i planned not to. I was afraid to ask questions, i had no plan and i kind of started with all sections at once. I started over again (over and over again) and everytime i added styling in CSS it became more confusing and complex.

After all this panicing i started with a "mobile first" approach. Focusing on making the header first. Using flexbox i styled it in three different ways depending on which screen you use. 

When i felt happy with my header i continued with my news section adn small nes sections. All with flexbox. In tablet view the small news cards where flex-wrapped to two rows. And in desktop four card rows. 

I really used the help from my team (ALOT). They looked at my code and gave me input and made me learn the things i missed in my CSS to make the cards wrap. 

Next time i will be more organized. Taking it step by step. Making a plan of what i need to do and narrow it down.
