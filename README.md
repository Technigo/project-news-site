# News Site

This was the first project on the Technigo boot camp. The assignment was to make a responsive news site using CSS flexbox and/or grid.

## The problem

I started by drawing simple sketches for mobile, tablet and desktop views using pen and paper. I then tried to redo the sketches in Figma, but got stuck almost immediately when focusing on design and content instead of the structure of the website. Instead of trying to get on with the structure I spent a silly amount of time googling and downloading pictures of Backstreet Boys. To shift my focus I tried to see the content as empty boxes within boxes. That made it easier to focus on the HTML skeleton. 

At first I really struggled with understanding how to set up my flexbox parents och flexbox children. After the code sessions I redid my flexboxes a few times to try to simplify the code. I then added a CSS grid section, following one of Technigos instruction videos. The finished site contains both flexbox (header, big news section, article section and footer) and grid (article section).

I also spent too much time fixing margins and padding. I would love to have a UI guidebook on font sizes and margins on different devices. 

I styled my photos to look like tilted polaroids and added some hovering effects on all articles using both "ordinary" CSS and @keyframes. 

If I hade more time I would have tried more animations and hovering effects. I would also have liked to play around more with flexbox and CSS grid.

I didn't have a specific design in mind when I started building the site but just added things as I went along, wich took a really long time in the end. Next project I hope to have a design ready before I start coding.
