This was my first project in Technigo Bootcamp, the assignment was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. TThe requiremnts for this assigntment was that the site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. Use flexbox to layout the page and to create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

This project has been very good from a learning perspective, it has been a lot of trial and error but that is how I learn the best.
