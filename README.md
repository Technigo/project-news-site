I wanted to focus this assignment on understanding Flex, especially the responsive mobile first design.Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

The problem
I started off with desktop even though I understand it is easier developing mobile first. But I felt I needed to do it this way to easier understand how everything is structured. So I focused on flex instead of css grid, partially because I feel that flex is more versatile but also because I would like to work and understand one at a time. I didn't really understand how to set upo navigation only using flex (and html of course) so I dug into javascript a bit as well. Didn't turn out to good though.... :)
Next time I would start mobile first and work from there for sure.
