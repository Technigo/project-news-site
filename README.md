# News Site

The task was to create a classical magazine or news site using CSS grid and flexbox. The site was supposed to be responsive for mobiles, tablets and computers. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out trying to make the structure of the layout, putting to practice the concepts of grid and flexbox, seeing which one to use where and how. I rewatched the videos many times, googled and googled, asking friends with experience and a lot of trial and error with the code.

If I had more time I would try to add more elements, like a sidebar, footer or a hamburger menu. I would also like to play more with the design of the page.
