# News Site

Making a responsive news-site and choosing a theme that I picked myself and build it from scratch. The webpage should have a title,logo and navbar and different news card/articles. I choose to do a desktop first approach. 

## The problem

The first time I created a responsive webpage and working with media queries,flexbox,grid and other elements. I used figma for making a sketch and to plan my project news site. Then a started coding, googling, looking at videos at youtube and asking question in the groupmeetings. There were many problems and a lot of googling etc.

If I hade more time, I would make animation, more hover effects and boxshadows. I would also fix my text better.
