# News Site

Build a responsive newssite using flexbox layout and media queries.

## The problem

I started to sketch out the layout of my page and figured out what sort of newssite i wanted it to be. I read up on flexbox, boxmodel and media queries. Watched youtube clips and the Noops challenge also really helped clear things out when i got stuck. I spent quite long time to get the images to be the same size on the smaller "news cards" and i'm not sure if the solution i found really is the best practice but it worked. If I had more time I would have wanted to add animation, more complex hovering, a newsletter form and do the footer more stylish.
