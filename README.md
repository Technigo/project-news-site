## The problem

I missed the step where there was a github-project to start from, so my approach was a bit different.
I started from the point "what should it be about" and started strukturing the page from the HTML-point of view. I looked at other similar pages and tried to analyze how they had build it.

When I stumbel across new commands I try to google and learn what their funktion is and how I can apply it in my work.
