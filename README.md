# News Site

Technigo student project for making a responsive News Site with Flexbox and Grid.

## The problem

Tried to layout the page after the newssite-sketch.png, started with just dummy content then I thought it would be fun to just keep it generic.
Went for mobile first, used Flexbox for card content and Grid for making small news portion change number of columns depending on the sites width. Added custom font, some underline animation for navigation links, boxshadow for cards, used some variables for color scheme. Hid some text/links for mobile version.

If I had more time I would've wanted to make the header with site name, logo and navigation links better.
