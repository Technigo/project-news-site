# News Site

// So this project is to make a news site or a classic magazine site. My first thought was to make something that I feel kinda passionate about - plants. 
But then it got me thinking if that's a news site? Maybe I can make it into one then! //


Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

//So the first thing... How do I want it to look? What do make it about? I know I want somber, light colors. I know I want hover effects over the boxes. I took insperation from the noops code along and a website selling retreats.

So I started to sketch. I wrote down i a simple google docs - what is required of the assignment? //
