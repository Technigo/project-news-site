# News Site

Assignment: To create a classic magazine or newspaper site with an extensive news section and a grid of cards with other news. The name of the site should be in a header, there should be a logo, and a navbar and the site should be responsive whether the page is viewed from a mobile device, tablet, or desktop. 

This site mimics a classic magazine about the best animals in the world: Cats. The site contains interesting facts, tips for pet ownership, and quotes pertaining to cats. 


## The problem

 Apart from some of the examples from Technigo's videos there were also information from blogs and forums. If there would have been more time one of the pages (News & Reviews) would have been prettier on mobile.
