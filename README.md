# News Site

Created a news site about dog new's from a dog's world. 

## The problem

I wrote the base code for desktop instead of mobile, as recommended. Next time, I will do mobile first.
I planned a general layout, then began writing the HTML and then CSS. If I had more time I would've started with mobile first and also added more styling.
