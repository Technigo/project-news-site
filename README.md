# News Site

Built a tech news website using CSS grid and flexbox to layout the page. The site includes a header, a main news 
article, a grid of news articles, and a footer. 

## The project

I began with a project prototype using figma. Then added the html structure and styled the page using a combination 
of CSS grid and flexbox. To accomplish a design with four cards in a row for desktop view, two cards in a row for 
tablet view, and one card on each row for mobile view. 

I would like to add more functionalities to the website, for example having the navbar and footer links go to new pages.
Aswell having an onclick event listener on each card to jump to a page showing the entire article.
