# News Site

This weeks assignment was to build a news site. 
I choose to do one that displays art, travel and exhibitions since that's my current field and I have the pictures for it. 

## The problem

This is my first time building a responsive page so I learned about CSS, Flexbox, Grids and media queries.
Also took a deep dived into HTML. There is so much that Iâ€™ve learned this last week. 
When a problem arose, I either googled, asked a programer friend or my classmates.
