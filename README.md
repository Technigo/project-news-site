# News Site

This is my finished news site project. It's called "Terrier Times" and it's a fictional news site that follows the lives of Odette and Tuutikki, my parents' dogs that are very dear to me.

## The problem

I used Grid and Flexbox to build the layout, and played around with CSS. My biggest issues came with trying to make the site responsive, but I got help for that in the Slack group fortunately. If I had more time, I'd style the mobile versions more carefully as they're now just basically modified versions of the desktop one (not recommended, I know... :D)
