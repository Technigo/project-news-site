# News Site

This project was about building a responsive news site with flexbox.

## The problem

This was my first time using flexbox, so there was a lot of trial and error.
Next time I will include all boxes in the sketch and build the structure of the page before inserting the contents.

I had some trouble using the media queries for specifying the styling of the tablet and mobile version. The issue was that the query worked fine for the mobile version but not for the tablet version. At some point I switched places for the queries, putting the tablet query first and then it suddenly worked. I'm not sure why the order matters, since they should be mutually exclusive according to my logic but it seems to matter.
