# News Site

This weekâ€™s project is a newspaper site. The site contains a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news.

## The problem

I struggled mainly with the images, keeping the layout responsive and to not repeat the css code to much. I had to start from the beginning and re-do it a few times. My plan was to start mobile-first and then moving from header/nav and down the page. If I had more time I would make more styling and work on the columns for the news cards.
