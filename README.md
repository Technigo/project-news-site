# News Site
📰 The goal of this project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site.
It should contain a main news area and a grid of cards with other news.
Since one of the main missions is to practice responsive pages, the navigation bar should change when going from mobile to tablet to desktop displays.

## How I built it

👩‍💻🔨 I decided to use Flexbox for most of the layout. The page is divided into 3 main sections: Navigation bar, Main news section and News cards section. Each of them is a different Flexbox container so I can play with the positioning of the child elements.

## What I learned
- 🎉😎 This is my first time building a responsive page, learned about media queries.
- The logo has a small shaking animation, when implementing it I learned a bit about keyframes.
- Deep dive into semantic HTML, CSS hover effects and Flexbox.
- Learned a lot about default styling that some browsers apply and how we might need to override them to get the results we want.
- The more I build projects, the better I become at planning efficient CSS selectors (yay!~~ 💖💪)
