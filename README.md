# News Site

This project has been the very first webpage I have done! The goal was to build to work with either flexbox or grid and media queries to create a repsonsive webpage. 


## The problem

Since this was the first time for me, my goal was to create a website with a proper build up and structure. I think this was my biggest challenge besides from proper css selection. I started working with my desired design in figma and also mobile-first. If I had more time I would try to better understand the proper strucuture of HTML, how to select in CSS in a cleaner way and also how hiearchy works. 

 I struggled a lot with the image cropping and the flex box of the bigger articles. I would have wanted to not mix viewport and %, and I would also have designed the big article differently (I tried, and failed with row-reverse)
