## The problem

I didn't meet all the requirements for this project first time. This time I changed the classnames as the first time I didnt understand grids and the names were "grid-one" and so on. This time around I still had trouble with the grids on tablets. Something was probably conflicting but I got it solved out. I kept the most of the default code in the responsive sections as its a lot easier to tweek for changes.
