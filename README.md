# News Site

The focus of this project is to create a news site with responsive design.

## The problem

I started with the basic layout, then added styling. Halfway through I realized I was working on too many things at once, and used a Trello board to structure my work. The biggest change was that I changed from flexbox to a grid system for the main parts of the site.
