# News Site

This is my first project of the Technigo Bootcamp.

I need to create a fully responsive news site using HTML and CSS.(use Grid and Flexbox)

## The problem

I wanted my site to look as an old recipes book and mantain a "rustic" style.
I've made on paper a scheme to visualize the main containers and organize the structure of my page. For the Nav menu I got inspiered from the "maple's news site" and I adapted the same kind of menu to my needs. For the cards and the form sections I've got inspiered from some CodePen samples that I liked. I used w3schools to have a complete view of the different CSS properties. I also added a simple subscription form (the submissions are collected on Netlify as well) What's next? I would add some animation to the buttons on hover and create a single html for every recipe with different impagination. I would also try to insert some sound effects for every recipe preparing process.
