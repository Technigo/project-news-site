# News Site

This is a project I completed as part of the Technigo bootcamp. The purpose of the assignment was to create a news site with focus on responsiveness and learning how to use Flexbox.

I decided to make a site with _fictional_ good news. I found design and layout inspiration from the Swedish newspapaer [Dagens Nyheter](https://www.dn.se/), as well as [AdAge](https://adage.com/) and [VanityFair](https://www.vanityfair.com/). 

## The problem

I started of sketching the news site in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LI3xMNM53jmrUhP72vG3FZ/Project-2-News-site?node-id=101%3A5630) after doing some inspiration research on previsouly mentioned news sites. I layed out the site on mobile, tablet and desktop so that I had a clear vision of what I neeeded to create. From the beginning I thought I'd do a crazy version of _Dagens Nyheter_, but then ended up changing it to a fictional news site named **_Good News Only_**. 

I then, being excited over my first real project, started with creating a basic html and then going quite quickly into css to add my colors and fonts I designed in Figma. It was not under day 2 or 3 that I realised I neeed to really focus on getting the responsivness to work before spending time on selecting one of the thousand fonts on Google fonts.... :) 

I struggeled a bit to align the content center on page and get the various child elements to behave the way I wanted so I decided to remove some of the styling and adding a '<2px solid black border>' to **all** elements in order to really understand what belonged to what flexbox, that was a great learning that helped me so much and something i will use as part of my routine moving forward. 

Once I had achieved the mandatories of the assignment I moved on to the extra curricular items and tried out some hover animations. I also got stuck after having an idea that i wanted a video to play on hover on the logo. I might have spent a bit to much on this, but I really wanted to make it work so I finally asked on SO and received an answer within 5 minutes which helped me and I got it to work!

## Things I wanted to understand better and improve, but did not due to lack of time: 
- Setting different resolutions for images for different screens would have also been something I'd like to implement
- I also wanted to mediaqueries to include bigger screen than desktop
- Implement hamburger menu for mobile devices
