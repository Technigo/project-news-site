This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp. 

# News Site
The assignment was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. In addition to containing a header with name, logo and navbar; a "big news section" and a grid of cards, the site should also be responsive and the layout should change when looking at the site from a desktop screen, tablet or mobile.
