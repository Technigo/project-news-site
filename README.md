# News Site

This weekâ€™s project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The focus was to use what we've learned about responsive design and flexbox. I used flexbox in this version (but also tried css grid). The task was to code a layout with one-column for mobile, two for tablet and 4 for desktop where also the header would change depending on these widths. I added two animations: a shaky banner-text and a banner changing color. I also used hover effect on the cards and box-shadowing.

## Testing
The site acts the way it should on latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari. It also runs the way it should on all devices in devtools except Galaxy Fold. Here the header overflows and the footer is cramped.

## The problem and workflow
1. I browsed the instructions and then made a rough plan for the workflow (which I then strayed from almost directly...). 
2. I googled around looking for inspo on design and layout alongside doing the code-along and reading up on flexbox.
3. And then I did three different sketches for mobile, tablet and desktop.
4. After that I deconstructed the sketch trying to see what html-elements I would need and how to structure both html and css.
5. After that I started to write up the html and then continued with css.

Tools:
I used dev tools A LOT! I also had help from the other Hippos as well as from looking at Stack Overflow. I googled and googled and often found answers on the W3-pages.

Struggles:
I struggled with positioning items and wrapping my head around nested elements. Scaling images was also difficult. Another big issue was when I changed something in say the mobile version without understanding how it would effect the tablet and desktop. I spend MANY hours going back and forth between versions to try to figure out why my beautiful alignment all of a sudden was a disaster :)

Next time I think I will try to do the media queries section-wise and not at the end of the css. That is, to style for example the header in all versions together. I think that will help me understand better and I will not have to spend so much time srolling up and down.
