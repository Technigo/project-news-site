# News Site

This assignment was to create a newssite. The primary goal was to learn using flexbox-layout.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next

I started out creating a very simple layout, playing around with the flexbox-layout. I've used CSS and HTML for this task. If I had more time I'd liked to learn more about flexbox because I don't know if I've used it correctly.. when it comes to sizing the images that are inside the flex items. 
I would also have liked to use separate folders for the html, css and images but I had some problems in my Netlify publishing so I ended up using one folder. I hope this will be resolved for the next project.

I would also have liked to put more effort into the navbar in mobile mode, e.g. making a hamburger menu.
