# News Site

The assigment was to create a magazine or news site and implement:
-responsive design for mobile, desktop and tablet
-box model
-layout using flexbox

## The problem

I first chose a topic that inspired me and used Figma to make a mockup for mobile, table and desktop of the magazine site. Then I continued gathering all the images I need and planned in which order I would start coding. I saved each push on github in one independent vscode file in case I needed to went back a few steps.

I struggled a bit with some text floating outside the div element when oversizing the page to ipad view. I googled it and it seems to be a common problem in Chrome. I tried different properties of flex, flex-wrap, max-width and max-height and there was some improvement but not at 100%.

I searched for some tutorials to create the effects of the navbar and made some adjustments to my own taste and needs.

I inspected the page in Iphone 7/8 plus, Ipad and deskviews with the developer tools and looked fine.

If I had more time I would have added an animation in the logo and searched deeper for the overfloating text of the main article. Out of that I am happy with the result and had fun doing it.
