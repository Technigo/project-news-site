I had troubles getting the responsive feature to work, so I added different background colors for mobile, tablet and desktop. Then I saw that I had misplaced a curly bracket and that's why it didn't work to put it in desktop mode.

It was hard to get the layout to work as I wanted it to, both for the header and the main news section. I had to try both flexbox and grid to see the different results and then go for the one closest to my intentions (and in the main news sections, the float property geve me wath I wanted). I also tried dividing the page into sections in several different ways, to see how it changed the outcome.

I realised that a lot of my styling was the same for tablet and desktop version. Instead of repeating myself in two different media queries I decided to make one media query for everything bigger than a mobile. Then I have two smaller media queries with the css that is unique for tablet or desktop.
