# News Site

First solo project at Technigo Boot Camp. Create a responsive site with box design, using flexbox or grid.

## The problem

Due to life I had a late start on the project. I tried to plan and think it through before coding, in order to minimize unnecessary work. I made a sketch, trying to understand how the different boxes would need to be built to work in mobile/tablet/screen. 

I rewatched technigo-videos and livesessions, and did research on both grid and flexbox (youtube, stackoverflow and w3schools) before starting. Grid felt simpler, but I didn't know how to do more advanced stuff with it so I went all in with flexbox.

I'm not used to the mobile first approach, but it was a great way to work. I coded the "skeleton" of the site in html, and then focused on styling one part at the time. Having a tight schedule was actually great for structuring.

I couldn't use the technigo on call-help or q&a (but I watched and listened) because I hadn't discovered my road blocks at the time. But I asked my team (lions!) and different persons helped me with different problems. They are great!
I got help with my navbar, how to make the logo sitch place in mobile/tablet/screen. 
I got help with wrapping my "big news text" correct. 
I also got help with finding out why my google fonts didnt work at first. 

I saved the nav bar for last because I didn't know how to approach it. Once I had styled the entire page I had a better hang of flexbox and could understand how to google for answers. I also got valuable, pin pointed, help from my group. 

The last part I did was filling my site with content.

If I had more time I would create a footer. I would do more hovering effects on the images.
I would also like to create a similiar page using grid.
