# News Site

The assignment was to create a responsive news site using HTML and CSS. Topic of this site is how to create work-life balance.

## The problem

I was curious about using css grid and understanding the difference between it and the flex-box layout. My plan therefore started with the desktop-view, trying to fix a grid. From there everything became complicated :) 

My approach trying to solve the issues was to look up different forums like stackoverflow, w3school, youtube etc. If I had planned more carefully I think that my css code hadn't been as repetitive as it is now. Next time I will probably think more about rewriting the whole code, not just bits and pieces.  

If I had more time I would do some more research about width/height and responsiveness because I haven't really got a grip of it yet.
