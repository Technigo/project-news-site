# News Site

This was the project of week 2 at Technigo Boot camp. We were supposed to make our own news site about something, I chose to make a news site about training.

## The problem

I had a lot of problem because this is all new to me, but the mort challenging was to make a responsive design. It was also difficult to get used to flexbox and the box model, but with help from my team and many late nights I finished it in the end. If I had more time I would have done some things different, for exemple I would have tried "mobile first". I would also have made a footer and tryed out more effects.
