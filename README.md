# News Site
Project made for Technigo - Front end bootcamp 2020 

Build a responsive webpage in form if a newssite. 
I choose to make a less traditional news site more tailord to music and and nightlife. 
I didn't want to much text ruining the visual, so the idea was that you'd click on the pictures and then be directed to the next page. 

## The problem

I had some problems with the grid section, making the cards the type of containers I was looking for. 
The grid in itself wasn't to difficult but then making the cards behave as I wanted was trickier.
