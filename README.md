# News Site

A news-site; made to practice responsive design, flexbox and grid in CSS.

## The problem

I started designing everything for the computer, when I really should have gone mobile-first.

I fought a lot with CSS, especially image sizes, and positioning, but with a lot of trial-and-error and copious use of "Inspect Element" I got it figured out.

I need to learn more about naming conventions and get better at the @media rule. I also constantly thought I was either making it too simple, or too advanced, lol.
