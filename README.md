# News Site

This project aims to produce a template for a responsive news website. The specification of the task requested to have 3 different layouts: for the phone, tablet and desktop. The layout should include a header with navigation bar with a logo, the main news section, the section with 4 various news, and a footer. The news sections should include images. 

## The problem

I started with creating a basic structure for the HTML file and included all necessary elements into my basic structure. After that I added basic styling to the CSS file to see the difference between various sections. When I settled with the basic structure and styling, I proceeded to address the issues of responsiveness.

    ### Responsiveness tools and approaches
    I have decided to use both CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to arrange different sections and make them responsive. I have decided to keep the same Grid arrangements for both tablet and desktop view to avoid too much “movement” on the website when changing from one width to another.

    ### Arranging images
    To explore different ways of working with images I decided to have one section where images are set out as background image rather than next to the text or above it. I also gave a bit of a difference between different sections visually.

    ### Effects
    As part of the assignments, we were requested to have some hover effects. I used a number of hover effects such as change of background color, changing the color of the box shadow, scaling of the picture, and changing the color of the border.
