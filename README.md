# News Site

The assignment was to create a single page news site, practising to structure a webpage using boxmodel, layout the webpage using grid and flexbox, and finally to make the page responsive for mobile, desktop and tablet.

## The problem

I started too late and I didn't know the tools well enough to plan. However after learning grid and flex I was able to make a proper scetch of the page and this helped me to understand when it was best with grid and when with flex. If I had more time I would learn more about how to style the different parts of a page, now its all in one color.
