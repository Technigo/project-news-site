# News Site
The main task is to create a responsive news/magazine website by using CSS gird and flexbox. 

## The problem

The challenge was to display different header items on mobile, tablet and desktop screen. 
It was solved by placing two logo items and display them by media queries.
Another issue was setting wider column width than screen width, for example, grid column minmax value was wider than container width that caused broken layout in mobile screen.
