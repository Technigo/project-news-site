# News Site

The assignment was to build a news site whom should be responsive within tablet, screen and mobile view. I decided to create an online magazine for a sports event I'm co-hosting, with "mobile first" approach. My site "Skaft√∂ Open Magazine" includes a header, a navbar, one main news section built with flexbox, a second news section with smaller boxes built with grid. All news-boxes on the site is also built with opacities, so they are just showing the real "strong" colors when highlighting them. I also added some styling to the smaller boxes within tablet and screen width, so they shows as polaroids when highlighting them. 

## The problem

I started with a very high level sketch to later on developed into reality. I mainly used flexbox and grid, and I sometimes struggled with having them act in the way I wanted. To make the grid-boxes to look nice, I made the grid a parent itself, so it could act both as grids but also their children could act as flexboxes. I made it in this way, so that the content within the boxes would look nice with centered content. 

If I would have had more time, I would probably have put more effort into the "designing part", i.e. add some color to the site background and fonts - but I made a safe move with keeping it simple with a minimalistic design. I would also have added more animations such as hovering effects to the fonts in the nav-bar as well as extending the content.
