## Production Process

I started the project by planning it on paper and creating a basic sketch. When I started coding, I got too excited and stopped following the initial plan. I then decided to start again, following the plan and using the mobile first approach. I reused parts of the previous code and was able to create a cleaner code and more pleasing looking web page.
