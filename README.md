# News Site
Goal: building a responsive webpage by using CSS Grid or Flexbox to layout the page.
Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.
The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.

## The problem

I had problems with using Flexbox and getting the columns to work and the main picture to fit in i nicely into different window sizes. I have been copying and pasting a lot not really understanding how to understand the flexboxes, I have watched the videos and tutorials but should go back to those instead of coding too much getting a head ache.
