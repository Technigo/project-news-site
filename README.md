# News Site - [View Live!](https://ylvas-news-site.netlify.app/)

The assigment was to create a responsive webpage with the theme "News Site". The layout should change from mobile, tablet and desktop view.

## The problem

### Techniques
I was using techniques as flexbox, media queries and semantic HTML.

Have added hover effect for the nav menu when the screen is wider than 1024.

### Planning
I started with mobile first and then scaled it up for tablet and later on desktop.

I thought it was pretty tough with design of my site and choose a theme, color, images and icons.

### Had more time, what would be next
* Footer - To be at the bottom for all screen sizes and when I have less news cards. I'm struggling a bit to understand position relative and absolute.
* Other news card - Odd numbers of cards, tablet and desktop view, how to handle a new row that has one card less then the above but still get the cards to start left on the new row. I still want everything in ceneter.
* Screen sizes - Understand when you can set the max-width, I have a really wide screen at home and I saw that when I was scaling up my site didin't behaved as wanted.
