# News Site

This assignment was to build a responsive News Site that works on desktop, mobile and tablet. I structure it using box model and use FlexBox for the layout. 
My news page has a animated logo to the left, static hamburger menue on mobile devices, line-gradie background, hover over effects on images and links.

## The problem

I started by reading and watch all course material. Then I followed the Code Along video to create a structure. From there I kept on building, adapting it to how I wanted it to work and appear. I also watched some crash courses and tutorials when I got stuck.

If I had more time I would make the links go somewhere, add a drop menu to the hamburger, make the hamburger change color once you scroll further down on the page. I would also add a footer.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
