# News Site

This project was made by me the 2nd week of the Technigo bootcamp.
We were supposed to learn how to structure webpages using box model, flexbox and how to make it responsive for mobile, destop and tablet.

## The problem

My biggest problem was to make my pictures come out in the direction I wanted and lack of time. I wanted to do a newssite that reminded me of New York Times.
