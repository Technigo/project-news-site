# News Site

This is the first assignment of Technigo bootcamp.
This project is a simple template for a news website. The site has to be responsive and should work well with mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

First I designed it on Figma ([follow this link](https://www.figma.com/file/kxwhrnL9gmhk29Dc1X8dPG/dev-news?node-id=1%3A2)). The approach is mobile first to make this project responsive.
To make the styling as flexible and scalable as possible, I used CSS variables and also some CSS functions such as calc(), var() and hsl(). This approach helped me to have more control over the design.
I used CSS normalize to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
