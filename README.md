# News Site

This project is a responsive newspaper webpage, developed as an assignment with the aim of practising both CSS Grid and Flexbox in laying out a webpage. 
The page has a main news section and under that 4 cards of news items when viewed on a desktop, 2 cards on a tablet and one on a mobile.


## The problem

After sketching out my 3 different views for the page, I implemented the header and footer using Flexbox. I decided to use the provided Technigo logo this time. The midsection of the page, where the news items are presented were laid out using CSS Grid. 

Additionally, in the mobile view, I decided to further display each news item card with Flexbox as I didn't manage to layout the text to the side of the picture with CSS Grid alone. 

Javascript was also used in the header, to listen for a click on the menu icon in mobile view and then display and hide the navbar. 

If I had more time I would further experiment with doing the whole page with only Flexbox and with only CSS Grid. I would also try to make my own logo and further develope the site with individual pages for the news items in which I could experiment with different layouts of the page.
