# News Site

My first Site in the bootcamp and the first site to code on my own overall. 

The assigment was to create a news page with a main news section, followed by smaller news cards.
The site has to be responive and work well with mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

1. Huge struggle to set up the technical, as git and github. I solved it by going through the materials from Technigo, looked on stackoverflow and in the end I asked a student from earlier class to give me some guidience. 

2. I struggled to align the big and small news containers. When I added the header and footer I couldnt get the full width. I googled the issue and read up on stackoverflow. I also had my team and a former student to look at my code. I found the problem, (added padding to elements not needed) and corrected it.

3. I created a hamburger menu that I have tried to get to work. Looked at youtube tutorials, googling and read on w3school but havent got it to work properly. Due to time limit I choose to put it a side and continue  with other functions that was required. 

4. I take with me to the next project to plan better, start with core structure and functions, to work in sections and commit more often. 
And to practice my asking and googling skills.
