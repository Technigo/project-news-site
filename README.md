This project is done as a part of Technigo boot camp. The focus for this project was to create a magazine website with a responsive design and a flexbox layout.

## The project

My starting point in this project was mobile first and then to add two media queries for tablet and desktop view.
 
I struggled with the concept of nested elements in flexbox and to find a way to both stretch and center the content without having unwanted margins. My solution was to give the body and the header container a width of 100% and for the card-container I used the stretch value for the align-items property.
I used percentage instead of pixels for most of my elements to make sure that they would size-up and be compatible with the different break points in the media quaries. I did have a difficult time finding a way to have the same size on all card images but solved it by setting a height and adding object-fit: cover to the image element.

I worked with box-shadows and hover-effects to get the cards and links to pop out a bit and to make it more easy for the user to see what is clickable and not.

I used dev-tools a lot to keep the design inline with what I wanted for the different breakpoints in the media queries. I frequently visited stack overflow to get answers to my questions.
