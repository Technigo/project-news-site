# News Site

Within the project the task was to create a news page on a specific topic. I just oved to Berlin a decided to create a newspage about what is happening in Berlin.

## The problem

The project asked to inclued a navigation bar, a large news and several smaller news. It should be responsive using Flex and Grid. Both are new tools for me so I decided to combine them within the newssite. Before starting to code I sketched the idea. In addition I created a low fidelity prototoype in Figma to get an idea of the design. In regard to coding I devided the site into the navigation bar and the main page. The main difficulty was to create the responsivness starting with an mobile first approach. In regard to the navigation bar that could be improved.
