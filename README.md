# News Site

The assignment was to build a responsive news site that consists of: 
- A responsive design with different views for desktop, table, and mobile
- A header, a main news article, and a grid of news articles
- Styling including hover effets

Stretch goals that I reached include:
- Adding a box shadow to each article
- Aligning the cards to the center of the page

## The problem

I approached the problem by first focusing on creating a working skeleton of a site, and then adding content. After an intial sketch of my layout, I spent a lot of time reseraching flexbox and grid and testing how they worked to make sure I grasped the concept. I tested these techniques by creating simple codepens to look only at isolated problems.

After getting comfortable with the techniques, I started with my project. I used grid for the main strucutre of my news articles to be able to have more control on the layout, and combined it with flexbox for the navigation in the header.

If I were to have more time I would look into using animation with the collapsed "hamburger menu" on the mobile view of the site as well as setting a max width to control the view on larger monitors.
