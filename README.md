# News Site

The assignment was to create a responsive classic newspaper site (one page) that should include a header with logo and navbar, one big news article and a few smaller ones.

## The problem

To accomplish the assignment I used flexbox on both the header and the content with the articles. I started with the HTML structure and then styled one element at a time. For this project I styled desktop first which maybe was the wrong way to approach it since it's more optimal to do mobile first. If I would to do it all over again I would design mobile first. One thing I struggled with was to make the navbar responsive only using CSS. I solved it by arranging the list items in a column on mobile devices. If I hade more time on this project I would try to style the responsive navigation even more, maybe with a hamburger icon that expands on mobile devices.
