# News Site

Our assignment was to create a news page by focusing on using box modelling and flexbox for layouting, as well as making the site responsive.

## The problem

I started with adding all the content in the order I wanted them. After that I started layouting, from top to bottom, by creating parents with flex box and position the content as I planned. After that I continued on to style it. I had some trouble with that the content aren't lining up as it should and somethings wont keep being centered and are still slightly off. I firstly just used trail and error and tried a lot of different ways to move things and finally got lost in my own code and it became confusing. I then asked in Stack Ovverflow how to aproach this and got some good help. I also got great help from my team in Slack and Google hangouts to find were in my code something was off, when I couldn't find it myself. Unfortunately it didn't quite work all the way, and some things are still slightly off centered for some reason. If I had more time I would definitively ask for some more help with this. One problem I got last minute was that when you hover over a card, it goes a bit transparent, but then it lays over the header (if you scroll down a bit) instead of staying under it. I didn't get time to ask for help with this, so that's definitively something I would fix otherwise. As well as layout all the other sides. If I were to start over, I would plan and make a layout on paper first, so I could write down what parents and children leads were and what flex direction to use and such, so it wouldn't be as confusing and messy.
