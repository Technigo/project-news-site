The assignment was to create a website and use responsive design. 

## The problem
In the beginning I did a backlog. With everything I wanted todo and then prioritized to make sure that I had time to do all the important thing and the minimum requirements.

I struggled with the header to look good in all different website sizes not only mobile, ipad and laptop. 
Didnt really find a solution for that. 
Also had some problems with flex-grow. 

If I had more time I would:
1. Add some more comments add structure the code better. 
2. Look at different solutions for responsivness regarding headings and such.
3. Look into flex-grow more.
