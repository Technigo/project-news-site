# News Site

Brief was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The site were to have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. Furthermore the site should be responsive for different screeens: on desktop sized screens there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and one card per row on mobile.

## The problem

I had a very clear idea of my concept and the visual idea of the brief. I'am very happy with the styling of the page, and also the layout and set up in mobile view. I made a logotype from a fee svg-image, and added a decorateive font from Dafont for the heading. I am still to fine-tune the responsiveness (where I have been using flexbox), as it is not yet working in the disired manner for tablet and desktop. I also have a hamburger menu finished, but that need to be implemented into the project. In terms of planning I have learnt a massive lesson to always start by getting the technical aspects of the site to work properly - and not get carried away focusing on design detalis before the basic stucture is functioning.
