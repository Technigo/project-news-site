# News Site

In this assignment (Technigo bootcamp w2) we were supposed to create a newssite using flexbox and grid to achieve specific layouts for different viewports - responsive design.

## The problem

I used both flexbox and grid to achieve the layout i wanted. I started the project by choosing a theme and then collected all content and placed it in my HTML. After that I focused on the CSS, styling and layout. 

If I hade more time I would have thoroughly gone through both grid and flexbox to really understand it. Now I had to wing it. However you learn a lot by trying things out.

## View it live


Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
