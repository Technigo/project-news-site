# News Site

This week's assignment is about creating a News site using flex or/and grid. Practising responsive design. 

## The problem

I started with sketching an idea of how I wanted the site to look like in desktop, tablet and mobile views. 
I started to write code and style it from top of the page. For example started with a top bar och finished the design of it and then moved on with the header, then navbar and so on. 
I saw and read the essential materials first and got some ideas of how I wanted to structure the code. And for some of the features I used Google a lot and StackOverflow, W3schools to find the answers. 
If I had more time, I wanted to approach the mobile version first. For this assignemnts I started with desktop, then tablet and lastly mobile. And want to try out Box Sizing!
