# News Site

The assignment was to create a responsive news site. It should include a header, a main news container and a container for other news. 

## The problem

I decided to approach the problem by trying to follow the instructions really closely. I chose to do exactly as the proposed sketch looked like and focus on learning the basics. I chose to use flexbox for my project, both for the navbar, "main news" container and "other news" container, and also for the footer. 

If I had more time I would redo the "other news" container using CSS Grid instead of Flexbox. It would've com more close to what I think it should look like once you fill in more text in the articles. Now I've the same amount of text and it looks good - but if I change the text so it's unevan - it'll look quite different.
