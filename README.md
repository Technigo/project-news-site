# News Site Project

Mission was to make a responsive news site using Flex box. With a header, main article and a few news articles. Responsive design for mobile (1 column), tablet (2 columns) and desktop (4 columns).


## The problem

I actually first started coding another project (the code along video we got in our project brief) so I was a bit late in the start for this (but hey I learned a lot). I also started doing sketches (in Adobe XD) but got back to just writing on top of the project sketch image we got. Then I started using Trello and a "needed things list". I also wrote my own brief document with a theme idea (Synths) and a few other websites around that theme, to have as inspiration for color and style. I used what I learned in the code along project (also on github) as a foundation for this project. I tried to get the core function of the site ready in time and let the "cooler parts" wait. 

I coded in VS Code, used Live Server to update and the Inspector in Chrome to view code and functions. I used Font Awesome for my social images.

If I hade more time I would like to put in some more interesting graphical/design parts, get the links and navigation to work. Also it would be fun to have a working hamburger menu on mobile.
