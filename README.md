Project week 2 of Technigo bootcamp

# News Site

This project is a responsive newspaper landing site, adapted to mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

I started this project by looking for inspiration on different news sites and deciding on what I liked best with them.
Since the project is mobile first I began sketching on the layout of the mobile site and it's different boxes and deciding which content should be visible and which should be hidden until another breaking point. I then continued with tablet and desktop - doing the same thing.

I started coding by structuring it in HTML and setting up the different news sections in sections and divs to be able to style it with flexbox.
I then tested my way to find the best fonts (from Google Fonts), sizes, margins paddings, colors etc.
As an animation I made a text shadow that continuously changes color for the headline title.

If I had more time I would work more on the header.
Maybe create a search field (at least for looks) and put more time on the news section links under the header.
Now I had to put most of time on figuring out flexbox.
