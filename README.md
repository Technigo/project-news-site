This project is made in order to learn the Box Model. The layout uses Grid or Flexbox for responsive webpages for mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

---

### How is page responsiveness achieved?

- Responsiveness is achieved through resizing and re-aligning the elements in a webpages in order to accommodate the different viewport and breakpoints used by the user.

### Tools and techniques used to solve it?

- Flexbox - distributes space along a single column or row.
- Grid - divides space into columns and rows. <i>Not all browsers support Grid yet.</i>

### Problem-solving approach

- I tried to use both Grid and Flexbox and experimented on how to do web layouts with them. I find Flexbox to be easier to use. Grid on the other hand has more complexity in using it. I used `<main>` semantic element to contain my cards and applied the necessary layout for the elements using Flexbox.

### Future improvements:

- I would try to use more Grid in layouts.
