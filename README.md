# News Site

This is my first project at Techinigo Bootcamp. The requirement was to create a responsive news site using flex box. 

## The problem

It was very difficualt at first to get a hang of flex box. I re-started the project many times until I could find a design and code that I was somewhat happy with. Next time I would spend more time on the actual sketch and do reseach before starting.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
