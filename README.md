# News Site

The assignment was to make a news site using flexbox or css grid. I made a magazine-site for millenials (like me) with a satire feel that is about various topics in our society. 

## The problem

I chose to use grid for this project, since I wanted the layout to shape the content. The first thing I did was to wireframe the project on paper. I made a grid-container with two different classes of grid-items within. One for the large news, and another for the smaller ones. If I'd had more time I would have combined grid with flexbox in the project, perhaps use flexbox for the header and navbar.
