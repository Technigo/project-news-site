# News Site

The assignment was to create a responsive news site that contains a header, big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On bigger desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

This is my first individual project and I am proud of what I managed to do and learn in the short amount of time.

Things I struggled with was how to crop the images to the same aspect ratio without them being stretched or squished to fit and still having images be responsive. I learned how to use “object fit: cover” and that percentages (%) refers to the parent and vh is used for the percentages of viewport height and vw is used for the percentages of viewport width. I also struggled with how I should name the different classes to make them clear for both me and others who looks at my code.

I’ve also learned how to use CSS Grid and flexbox, how to target a child while hovering a parent, basic CSS animation and a lot more.

If I had more time I would also have added a button to the bottom of the text block that says “Read more” and make it appear while hovering the article. I would also like to have the amount of text to be responsive and automatically fill the parent but I think that requires some JavaScript which wasn’t part of the assignment. I would also like to learn how to make a hamburger menu.
