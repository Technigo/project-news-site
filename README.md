# News Site - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.
Learning objectives:
  1. Layout webpages using flexbox.
  2. Structure webpages using the box model.
  3. Create a responsive webpage for mobile, desktop, and tablet.

# Brief
This weekâ€™s project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## Approach
After reviewing the provided "Tech to Learn" materials, I decided to build my site following the basic structure from the Code Along (Noops Clone). I picked a subject for my periodical and dived in!

If I had more time, I would change the 10 cloud type cards to have them flip over with the name of each type so they could be used like flash cards.
