This was my first project in Technigo Bootcamp and it was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. TThe requiremnts for this assigntment was that the site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. Use flexbox to layout the page and to create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

This project has been very good from a learning perspective, it has been a lot of trial and error but that is how I learn the best. I have realized that I can find all my answers just by googleing! (at least at this level, maybe not later ofc) 

What I'm not so proud of is the design, I'm not a designer which you can probably tell haha. 

In the end I wanted to make the images a link but doing the image resized and I did not have time look into how to fix it - hence it is only the heading that is clickable/a link. If I would had more time I would try to manage that and I would also put more time into to the header and footer. I would also have made links to real news article for all items in the grid. 

I struggled with finding out/know what override what, I added something and then something else changed.

Some questions I have:
- Using flexbox, what is the smartest/best way to set how many items/children that should be viewed per row? I use percentage of screen now, but is there any oter way? 
- I also would like to know the best way to set a space between the items/children. I would like to combine space-between and center/flex-start. Now I added a margin but what is the best way for doing this?
- If I want several (or all) anchor tags to open in a new tab, could I set that in CSS or is the only way to set it on each a-tag in HTML?

I really enjoy this, it has been a lot of fun!
