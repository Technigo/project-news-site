# News Site

The purpose of this news site was to learn and practise flexbox and responsiveness on a webpage.

I chose to set my media queries for big desktop to minwidth of 1600px which is larger than the general standard because I wanted adjustments for bigger screens as well. 


## The problem

When I encountered obstacles, such as CSS properties not doing the things I wanted, I read and watched guides on the internet and tried to break it down inside my head to really understand why it wasn't working.

I started off creating a Trello board of the assignment, breaking it down into several cards and checklists for pre-studies and practical work. I didn't plan much of the design ahead, instead I started coding when I felt that I had read up properly on the assignment. Going forward I will put a little more effort to actual planning of the website and design so that I have a clear picture of what I want the end result to be like.


If I would have had more time with this assignment I would have read up on and used CSS grids for the small news section. I would have also wanted to "complete" the site by creating several sub-pages for the "click here to read more.." links and worked a bit more on the design/appaerance of the website. I did not focus or put any effort into the text-content of the website, as can be seen on several places where there's still placeholders and "Lorum Ipsum"'s. I wanted to focus on coding and learning but if I'd had more time I would have made sure the website was updated with quality text-content.
