# News Site

This week's assignment is about creating a News site using flex and or grid. 
Also to make the site responsive between different devices.

## The problem

First I watched and read the materials that we had been given to get some inspiration.
Then I sketched out and idea of how I wanted the site to look. I started to code and along
the way I realised that I didnt fully understand how the flex and grid worked.
But I turned to stackoverflow and to my teamates, and I think I got the hang of it.
I  also started over a few times when I got stuck and didnt fully understand what the problem was.

For the next assignment I think im gonna structure the html first and not get stuck on the css.
