# News Site

The project was to design a responsive news page using flexbox.

I've added a header with an animated logo and a search bar, a navigation bar (in mobile view there is a hamburger bar) with a dropdown menu and social media buttons. I've added some box shadows and hover effects on the images and all the links, and a footer with a subscribe for newsletter box.


## The problem

My biggest problem was that I didn't plan enough ahead and that I didn't start with the mobile first approach. So I had to go back and change that later, which I think took a lot more time than if I had done it from the start. And also, due to my lack of planning, I changed the design many times and often it messed with the responsiveness so I had to spend a lot of time just fixing up the code. Dev tools in the browser was a big help. Next time I will definitely plan more, skiss out the design and start with the mobile first approach.
If I had more time I probably would make all the links go somewhere, so you could actually get the recipes :)
