To create a basic news or magazine website about a topic of my choice.

## The problem

I started to sketch the webpage on paper using different colour for different parts so I easily could get an overview over what box/part should be text or image and to see what box would be inside another box. I sketched one layout each for mobile, tablet and desktop. I sketched in the requirements first and continued to draw boxes how i wished it to be - boxes within boxes and so on until I was satisfied with the layout and structure.

Then I started to write the code with the help from my sketch. I searched on google, took help from W3Schools, StackOverflow and from the material from Technigo when I got problems or only needed confirmation that I was in the right track. I also talked i general with friends who work in tech, even if itÂ´s not as front-end developers, and got some ideas how to manage some problems.

If I had more time I would do a menu with a submenu. I didn't manage to do it know. I also would have experiment more with different image orientation and mixed them in the news grid. I should also make the images size smaller so the page would load faster.
