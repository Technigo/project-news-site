## **Overview**

The project you will build is a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. What the news site is about is up to you - maybe dogs, plants or hiking?

### **The challenge**

Your task is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further, the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## **My process**

This was a project that I could feel comfortable with and make my own. First, I had to find a theme, and who
Doesn't like space, right? So I made Space News. I wanted the design of the landing page to be simple and easy to navigate and not have too many things on the page to make the user feel overwhelmed in any way.

I started with making my figma design, link below, and went to Google Fonts about finding a nice font that felt like a good theming of the page. The design was for the desktop version of the page, I used it to be an inspiration for the mobile and tablet views.

I did the skeleton of the HTML first and added the css and javascript in a "second phase".

Not much JS was used, since it only was for the dropdown on mobile view.

### **Built with**

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### **What I learned**

The project guidelines was not very harsh, so I had the pleasure of getting to make my own design in Figma. This was very great opportunity for me to get more comfortable with the tool.

The greatest challenge in this project was for me to learn about the Grid. Before this challenge I have not used it much, but I'm happy with the simple use-case and I got a great understanding of how to use and implement Grid.
