# News Site

I did a news site about crossfit news

The brief was to make a simple news site/magazine site.
It should contain a navigation bar, layout with flexbox and css grid, images and also it should be responsive with one main article, and then 4 "cards" with news on a desktop, 2 on a tablet and 1 on mobile phones.

## The problem

I went through all the pre-course material, used hours and hours of Google, Youtube and the helpful people in the Slack channel.
I managed to get the site almost responsive but not a 100% - I will hand it in anyway and hope to get some time to finish after the change requests.
I can see in VS Code that my code has some errors but here I'm insecure and would need the hands-on assistance from someonew more experienced. 

The tools and techniques I used to solve it was many different Codepens to practice flexbox, grid etc. Trial and error, try again etc. 
I finally managed to get a decent result on the assignment but if I had more time I could probably do it better.
I would make the site 100% responsive at it isn't that right now - only almost responsive... I would also style the navigation bar better - I can see that the green for "Home" is below the other ones but this I'm not sure how to fix right now.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
