# News Site

The assignment was to learn a little about HTML, CSS and CSS Grid and Flexbox in particular. The page had to be responsive regarding numbers of columns etc (desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns and mobile 1 column).

## The problem

I decided to start off with the mobile version and later add media queries for larger screens.

The page consists of three sections: navbar, big news section and other news section. I decided to start from the top of the page with the navbar.

I had played around a little with flexbox before and I had an idea of how to get the navbar to look the way I wanted with flexbox, so that's why I started with that.

After styling the navbar I moved on to the big news section. For some reason I thought flexbox would be the best solution for the big news section so I started styling the section with flexbox. The reason I thought that was probably because I hadn't used CSS Grid before and maybe felt a little intimidated by it at first.

Before I started I thought that CSS Grid would be best for the other news section because that was where all (the soon-to-be-)responsive columns was gonna go.

When I was more or less done I decided to change the navbar for tablet but then I thought everything looked weird and I started to realise that it probably would have been better to use CSS Grid for everything except the navbar. It's a matter of taste, but to me the end result might look a little messy. The image and textbox in the big news section are not aligned with anything in the other news section and that could probably have been achieved easier with CSS Grid.

I still thought it looked kind of the way I wanted it to and I did not have the time to start over or change it, so I decided that I was done with the styling of the page.

There are a lot of things I would fix if it was supposed to be a "real" page and I had more time, for example: the button is not a link/clickable and neither is the images in the other news section, even though they behave a certain way when hovering over them with the cursor. Some things I did just to practice and see how it worked, for example I used some CSS variables for the colors and the font (even though I only used one font for the whole page). 

The images are downloaded from unsplash.com and I resized and cropped them to make them fit and behave like I wanted them to.
