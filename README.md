# News Site

Project 
Build a News Site: 
Create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem
Is trated by watching the tutorial videos to learn about boxmodel, grid and flexbox. I practise the coding on my own and used figma to create a sketch for the website and the different view alternatives starting with mobile first. I think I went a bit over my head and confused myself in the code when I combinde flexbox and grid layouts and struggled with positioning. I had to take a step back and decided to only use the grid to create the layout of the page. I played around with some hover effects and if I had more time I would have made the images inside the grid container in the same size when displayed in tablet and desktop view.
