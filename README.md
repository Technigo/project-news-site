# News Site

The objective with this project was to build a news website with a responsive design using flexbox and CSS grid. 

The result is a template website with mock content for "Nature Live News".  

## The problem

 The aim was to have a a section with 4 column card view on desktop, 2 on a tablet and a 1 column stacked view on mobile. Random gifs and images from unsplash were used to populate the content of the site. 

## View it live
