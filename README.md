# Technigo web development bootcamp august 2023 - jan 2024: project 1

This is a solution to the first project for the students:
Your task is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further, the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

We suggest that you start thinking about what your page will look like. Have a look at the design sketch below and create your own one, we suggest using [figma](https://figma.com) or [figjam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) or simply on paper. Remember that you can always go back and change your sketch along the way.

**What you need to do**

✓ Style your page.
✓ Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the page.
✓ Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.
✓ The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.
✓ Play around with hover effects, i.e. change colors, add or remove borders or flip the image upside down.

- Stretch goals
  Shall only be realized after having sent in basic solution.
- Add a box-shadow to make the photos look like polaroids -> did not like that, picked brightness
- Align the cards to the centre of the page
- Add some CSS animations to your project

## My process
- making a sketch with figma to check out colors
- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned

More on positioning img in grid/flex cells which can be tricky sometimes. Made a sketch in figma, figured out how to dynamically change back-color of grid cells thru :nth-child(xn+y), used filter attribute for img 1st time.

### Continued development

Getting more routine in placing items in grid/flex cells.

### Useful resources

w3schools, dev.mozilla.org, stackoverflow
