I designed a site and scetched it on paper. I then tried my way and failed many times. I atrated over and I found two separate tutorials about the navbar/header and the grid layout. I followed it step by step, googeling what i did not understand and tried my best in puting it all together. I wrote comments in the code along the way so that I would understand what I was doing.
