# News Site

The assignment was to create classic magazine or newspaper site adhering to a provided guideline. Both Flexbox and CSS Grid should be used and the design should be responsive.

The news site is that of Gondor Gazette - a fictional newpaper from the Kingdom of Gondor, based in J.R.R. Tolkien's world of The Lord of the Rings. Since 2023 marked the 20 year anniversary of the release of the movie The Return of the King, I decided that the newspaper would also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the return of their king. 

## The problem

I started by looking at other news sites for inspiration. I then drew up the design I wanted my website to have using FigJam, and used different colours to indicate which box adhered to what section. A lot of fun was had coming up with fictional news stories. 

I used grid-template-areas for the overall main section, as it was easy to convert to different media queries. I then proceeded to use Flexbox within the grid cards. 

Some features I wanted to include, such as a hamburger navigation bar that did not use Javascript, required quite a bit of research. A lot of time was spent googling, watching video explanations and reading how-tos.

At one point, some Flexbox-features didn't want to work in Firefox and I could not figure out why. I proceeded to remove elements to see how that affected the site. Eventually it worked, though I'm still unsure of what exactly it was that solved the issue. 

If I had more time, I would have used it to polish the aesthetic style of the site, like adding patterned borders between sections.
