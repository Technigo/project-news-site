# News Site

Making a responsive news site with flexbox using HTML and CSS for different outlets.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Tried to structure beforehand where I wanted to start and what to prioritize. Starting from top and working myself to the bottom with complete focus on function. Keeping it simple and don't get stuck on making it look perfect. Started off with a simple header and logo, and then began working with flexbox on the news content.

Making sure there were children working within their parent was a complete struggle. Had to Google, inspect over and over, ask for help and just try twenty different ways to make it work. The "big news" needed a display: block over the text section to look the way I expected it to - having the text next to the large image instead of under it or squeezed next to the headline.

Then went on a rollercoster ride trying to make the row of news cards work. Had to spend a lot of time structuring the elements and tweak the design to make it fit and function. Put every card in a div where I could style them to hold the content where I wanted them to. Wanting to have the cards aligned with headline on top, small paragraph between and then the image on bottom. Worked with aligning the cards to the baseline and justifying the content with space between so nothing would stand out too much in the parent section. 
Worked fine until I tried to center the content in each card. Nothing worked and content kept their position to the left - and I made an ugly solution with padding that pushed the children more to the right and therefor aligned to the center. Still not sure why no type of center styling worked on these divs. 

Continued with a footer that just contains a paragraph with who made the website and a "back to top" link underneath. Later added a form that would be useful for a newletter sign up. Also went back to the top and added a sidebar menu to it. At this point everything was in place and semi-worked but needed styling and more responsive design to work on every outlet.

The styling might not be that classic but I had fun doing it and stuck with my plan to keep it simple. Played around with hovering effects on most items on the site. The site title kind of glows up, the images gets a bit opaque, headlines that are links will be underlined and paragraphs italic. So played around a bit!
Wanted the computer version to be filled up with thicker borders and colors since white makes them feel empty and hard to fill that space. The tablet version is a neater version of computer so the borders gets thinner and the pictures in the cards takes up more space as they are two on two rows now.
The mobile version, the smallest one, is the one I'm most satisfied with. It's clean, nice on the eyes (mhm humble...) and looks like I imagined. The menu is now listed, the bakground changes but still keeps the color theme and the images takes up a larger potion of the screen.


Working with Flexbox as column was much more satisfying than the row direction. 





So I made a plan to start from the top and work my way down - so from header to footer and let the content evolve as I went on coding. Quickly realized that some "good looking" type of styling is not prioritized at all. Function, however, was the main goal. Getting a headline and logo was pain free and made it simple for myself to be able to focus on Flexbox. Getting the "Big news" 

Had a type of reader in mind when creating this type of news/entertainment site and wanted the over all look to feel a bit
