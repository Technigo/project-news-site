# News Site

This is a responsive newssite project concerning the most important information about food.

It's created with the mobile-first approach which displays news-cards in one column. When tablet-mode is activated it will show the cards in two columns. When it hits desktop it will show four columns of news-cards.

## The problem

I started out making a scetch on paper and tried to make it as similar as possible.

I had a problem getting vertical space between my cards since my height isn't specified. I posted a question on Stack Overflow and the solution was to add margin-bottom to .article-card which created the space I wanted.

If I had had more time I would have made the hamburger-menu actually display something. At the moment it doesn't display a menu and is not clickable.
