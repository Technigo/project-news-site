# News Site

The focus of the project is to create a responsive webpage using flexbox.

## The problem

I started the project by making a sketch in Figma, illustrating the layoute of the page on different views (mobile, tablet and desktop views)

The webpage is developed with the mobile-first approach. The structure of the page are based on HTML and styled with CSS. The layoute of the page is mainly styled using flexbox to create rows and columns to be responsive on following views: desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column. 

I stareted the project by creating a simple structure based on elements that made up several boxes och children and parents which I stylde, through an iterative process, with CSS. I begun to create the layout for mobile devices and then contunued with tablet and desktopt. When the layoute was done I added content to the site and styled each item. I added box-shadow to the images to create a subtil depth. The text are styled with different fonts ans sizes depending on its importance and to create the feel of a news site. 

The moste difficult part was to style the navigation bar since it contains several boxes, children and parents that are placed differently on the sceen in different views. In order to make it work I had to add and restructre some elements.

If I hade more time i would explore different solution with flexbox and grid to create the same layoute. I wolud also add a hamburger meny on mobile device.
