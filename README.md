# News Site

This is a the news site project. I've made a responsive design, by using media repositories, Flexbox and CSS Grid.

## The problem

I made a sketch with the different layots depending on the screen size. I then decided where to use Flexbox and CSS grid. This was my firt time using these techniques, so I'm happy with the end result. Maybe the different sections and their content could be sized better, but I'll work more on that in coming projects.
