# Technigo web development bootcamp august 2023 - jan 2024: project 1

This is a solution to the first project for the students:
Your task is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The site should contain a header with the name of the site, a logo and a navbar. This should also change depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further, the site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

We suggest that you start thinking about what your page will look like. Have a look at the design sketch below and create your own one, we suggest using [figma](https://figma.com) or [figjam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) or simply on paper. Remember that you can always go back and change your sketch along the way.

**What you need to do**

✓ Style your page.
✓ Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the page.
✓ Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.
✓ The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.
✓ Play around with hover effects, i.e. change colors, add or remove borders or flip the image upside down.
