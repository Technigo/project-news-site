## The problem

I started to make a sketch of how I wanted it to look like, using pen and paper. A lot of going through basics using mainly google, a lot of tutorials on youtube and the material given. We talked a lot in the team and helped each other out. If I had more time I would have made a "hamburgermenu" showing in mobile, I tried in the beginning but got stuck. And I also would have added more content to play around with grid. And a footer.
