# News Site

The assignment is to build a news-site with some basic elements, that have different views depending on if you’re on a mobile, tablet or desktop. 

## The problem

I missed the step where there was a github-project to start from, so my approach was a bit different than if I’ve used the provided template.
 
I started from the point "what should it be about" and started structuring the page from the HTML-point of view. I looked at other similar pages and tried to analyze with the inspect-panel how they had build it and how I could modify it into what I wanted to do.

When I stumbled across new commands I tried to google and learn what their funktion is and how I can apply it in my work and when I couldn’t find solutions for my problems I tried googling or tried to find a similar problem in stack overflow.

If I’d more time I would have tried to solve the final bugs that I couldn’t solve. The main issues that still bugg me is that I couldn’t center everything without there being negative consequences and I couldn’t transform the logo exactly how I wanted it without distorting the aspect ratio. After that the main thing would be to get the page interactive!

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
