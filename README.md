I put into practice flexbox and responsive design. Created a lay out using flex and CSS-grid. Flex parent in 1 colum in mobile view and then 1 row in desktop view. Grid in 1 column in mobile view, grid in 2 columns in tablet view and in 4 columns in desktop view. 

## The problem

1. My media query wasn't working until I changed this: @media (min-width XXXX) to @media screen and (min-width).

2. I had issues with the CSS grid as child-item 5 and 6 wouldn't break in 2 columns as the others grid-children in tablet view. Also in desktop view the grid-children 5 to 4 wouldn't break in 4 columns as the others grid-children. I based my grid on what I learn from the tutorial in the course material and tried different combinations of span but it didn't work.  

If I had had more time I would have tried to only use flexbox.
