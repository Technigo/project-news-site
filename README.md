# News Site

This is project 2 of the Technigo Bootcamp, and the first individual one.
The assignment was to create news- or magazine site, creating layout with Flexbox. It was also our introduction to responsive design.

## The problem
I did not plan this project properly, being eager to dive into coding, it also became clear during the project that I need to work in a more structured way. Lesson learned, next week I will take time to make a quite detailed mockup and backlog, and create a structure for my project.
All problems I encountered was solved with the aid of w3schools.com, google and some trial and error.
If I had more time (and knowledge) I would have liked to add a dropdown navbar to the hamburger menu in mobile size.
