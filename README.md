# News Site

The assignment to code a 4 column in desktop, 2 column in ipad and 1 column in phone news site had a few challenges since it was the first time. But hey, itÂ´s up! My first responsive page. 


## The problem

My biggest challenge is probably that I can not stop myself. Jumps straight into starting to code. Instead of reading, making a plan, sketching up a goal. If I were to start over, that's exactly what I would try to do. I also do not think that I have succeeded in not repeating myself in the code. There were a few lines ... HTML & CSS. Used both Flex and grid. Labbing with hover effects and small animations. If I had more time it would be really fun to add som pages, more content. Would lab more with the header, scroll animations. You really get hooked in this thing called coding... Time passes like fast forward.
