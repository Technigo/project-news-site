# News Site
In this project I have created a magazine webpage. 

## The problem
I have created a webpage for a travel newspaper. The design is mainly made with flexbox and the site is responsive. I have included some hover effects to the page. I have one header, one navbar, and a sign up form. The site has three two breakpoints, so you get different looks in desktop, tablet and mobile.
