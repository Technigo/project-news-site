# News Site

Responsive site using css grids and css flexbox, with some css animations (no JS).

## The problem

Biggest issues with the main layout, mainly with css grids.

Solved it with primarily with youtube. Also deep-dived into how css grid actually works, did a lot of research. 

Also solved it with redoing the whole code from the beginning, and started with doing the responsive columns before doing the header and the footer. Did it backwards in the beginning, which was not a good idea.

Planned using trello and a quick layout sketch on paper to make more logical how to use grids the best possible way.

If I had more time, I would spend more time making the site and the code cleaner.
