# News Site

This project is an excercise in HTML and CSS, the objective is to make a simple news site with "mobile first" development strategy, and to practise using flexbox and grid.
I wanted a news site with only positive news, so decided to name it Cloud 9 News, and picked theme and content to match.

## The problem

I made an overall checklist of things I needed to do, for example gather content and plan the overall layout, and in what order to do the tasks.
I started off trying to finish the mobile design first, and then move on to responsiveness, but along the way I decided to change strategy and finish each section for every type of device instead. I felt it was an easier approach to use since it meant I would immediately discover if my styling would become problematic when trying to scale it.
