# News Site

This is a newssite that wants the non vegetable world to find the joy in cooking and eating the fresh and colorful vegetables of the world! You may also be intrested in taking one of their classes in vegetables farmin or cooking.

## The problem

I started out making a design just with pen and paper for this one pager news site. I also googled my way around for some inspiration. I came up with a news site for farming and cooking vegetables. I know some flexbox from before but am pretty new with grid, so started with getting to know the grid technique so that I new how to use it. I did end up using grid for most elements on the page exept for smaller element like buttons next to each other, small desktop screen width for the small news and the navigation. I feel like I have more to learn with grid and if I had more time I would definitly build a bigger site with more (advanced and different sizes) elements.
