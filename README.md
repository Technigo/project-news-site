# Tennigo news site

Assignment was to create a news site with a main article section and a section with smaller articles. The site was to be responsive with different layouts for mobile, tablet, desktop.

## The problem

Flexbox was used extensively to create the different sections and articles. Different media queries to make the website responsive. I had some issues with image resizing and spent a lot of time trying to fix that. In the end I decided on an approach where images shrink proportinally to still fit in the flexbox (which also shrinks).

Added some animations to the smaller articles by using keyframes. Simple hover effects using borders.

If I had more time I would make it prettier. At this stage I wanted to focus on the coding elements rather than design.
