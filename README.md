I made a news-website about caf√©s/coffee using a header which conatins navbar, then a main-article section, other articles in cards, a social media row and a footer.

## The problem

The problem was that I started with the desktop view and when I wanted to rewrite the responsive for mobile/tablet view it didn't worked. So I started again after 3days-trying from zero and compare the two codes. The probelm was only one (...) character in the meta tag - instead of "-" I had an "=". So I decided that buying a bigger monitor and new eyeglasses becuase I have very bad eyes. Also I had some problem with the fixed navbar vs. animation but I asked on stackoverflow and one of my teammeat helped me with that.
