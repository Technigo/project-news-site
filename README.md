# News Site

This is a news site that uses both Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a responsive user experience. The 'cards' (articles) shrink, expand and rearrange themselves responsively to provide the best viewing experience on mobile, tablet and PC screens. 

## The problem

The challenge was to create a responsive website capable of rearranging and shrinking/expanding its content according to the size of the user's screen. 

I started by creating an HTML skeleton with the containers and container items needed to create a functional news site layout. I decided to primarily use Flexbox for the header/navbar and a CSS Grid layout for the 'cards'.

After setting up the initial layout and cards with HTML and CSS, I used 3 pixel categories of media queries to make the website responsive (mobile, tablet and PC). I then experimented with various CSS styling properties to improve the look and functionality of the website.

If I had more time, I would have looked more into UX design principles to improve the appearance of the website.
