# News Site

I created a 1-pager website for digging into the Bagel world, including the feature article about how bagel becomes popular and articles aside that are related to the baking, culture and recommendations of Bagel.

## The problem

I started by designing the structure, then pick the theme color of the website. Without saying, I also encountered obstacles, such as how to center the items, when to use grid vs Flexbox, how to create a hamburger-like nav bar etc.
I googled a lot along the way, also viewed several brilliant examples provided by the instructions.
