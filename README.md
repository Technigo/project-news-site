# News Site

News site about sloths (my spirit animal) containing three sections (header, big news section and news card section). 

## The problem

I focused on meeting the general and blue level requirements and started off by planning and coding the basic layout for each section. I used Flexbox since I already had som previous knowledge of that. Before this project I used to work on the responsive design in the end, but I find that this procedure worked out better for me ("Mobile first approach" and adding the media queries gradually during the process). In the end I had some time to focus on the details and improving the styling in CSS. If I had had more time I might have added some animations and tried out some more features in CSS.
