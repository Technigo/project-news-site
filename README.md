# News Site

The project this week is building a news site.
My news site is gonna be about XY.

## The problem

The steps I took to build the news site:
-paint a wire frame of the whole project on paper
-start with building everything in HTML
    -use Flexbox in the Navigation bar
    -use CSS Grid for building the site
    -use Media Queries for making the design responsive while working mobile first
-style everything in CSS and link the file in the HTML Head

## View it live
