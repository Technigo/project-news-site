# News Site

To create a responsive news sight.

## The problem

I started with the structure, getting all the elements into place, after that I did the site responsive.

I struggled with a lot of things and I didn't have enough time for doing all the styling I wanted, and working with deails and working with margin. I also didn't code the hamburger menu, but used an image. For next time, I want to learn how to code the menu as well.

But I'm happy I managed to get everything into place, make it responsive, add hover effects, and style it a little bit.
