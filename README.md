Since this is an educational assignment, I focused on learning and having fun. 

After a short attempt to plan my website beforhand, I decided I needed to be reading and writing simultaneously, re-doing and re-planing as I went. Knowing this is not the most efficant way of working, I came to the conclusion that trying things out and having an agile approach made me learn the most.

I read the Technigo lessions but have also googled a lot (of course) and inspected other sites. I looked at a lot of news sites.

The main layout is created using grid, while the content is aligned with flexbox. I found that using named grid areas worked well for this project - although I am not sure it holds up the same on larger/more complex sites.

Since I had a lot of time, I stretch the requirements - mainly to try out things I wanted to learn. Having more time and knowledge, I would have used more js. For example, I wanted to arrange the 'Most read' based on clicks, and the 'Latest' based on dates. Also, I saw that others don't really use 'onClick' to open the menu, so I want to know how that works.
