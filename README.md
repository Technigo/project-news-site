# Week 2 project: news site

For this project, we had to create a responsive (ideally mobile first approach) news site with header, one big news and some news cards arranged so there are fewer columns on smaller screens (typically 4 for desktop, 2 for tablet, 1 for phone).  We were invited to practice layout techniques Grid and Flexbox.

## The problem

I started by creating the logo and the design with the help of Figma, which helped mo the figure out how I wanted everything to be placed. For the coding, I made one part at a time instead of starting with a basic page and adding to it: first the header and when it was displaying as I wanted, I made the ticker, after that the big news, and so on. I wanted to try both flexbox and grid so I used flexbox for the header and the footer and grid for the main part. My CSS is structured with mobile first approach, so I used some media queries for screens >1024px. When every part was in place, I added some details in my HTML and CSS because I wanted to try many features: hover effects, mouseover text, box shadow, animation, drop-down menu, etc.

If I had more time, I would try to make an only grid/flexbox version to deepen my knowledge for these techniques. I would also do a bit more research to solve the ellipsis displaying problem with Safari. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the result.
