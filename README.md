## The problem

In the beginning i strugle with sections, divs and classes, and also when to use . before or not in css. With google and help from a collegue I solved it. I had trouble with responsiveness and still have between width 668-767. I have not been able to solve it. I still don't know when to use flexbox or CSS grid - maybe its up to me. To be honest I struggled with everything - but it was a lot of fun, including the headache :) 

NOTE! I missed both how to commit and create a pull request. This is now done.
