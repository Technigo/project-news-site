# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

This assignment is a simple newspaper site. It is responsive, has the right size for laptops, tablets and smart phones.

It consists of a nav bar with a logo, one main article (flex box) and four smaller ones(css grid).

Hyperlinks lead to new sites, some of them (when necessary) open in a new tab.

The theme of the newspapaer is realated to the recent trends in a digital design.

Articles used for this projects are copied from diffferent sources (names are mentioned on articles sites).

Simple and abstract images are made by me. 

## The problem

I started with designing the layout. I used a simple pen and paper.

I used both flex box and css grid. 

I made the web responsive by usage of media queries and a html meta tag.
