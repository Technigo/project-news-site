## The problem

For all my problems I googled and used web sites like: W3 school, https://css-tricks.com/, StackOverflow etc. Other tools I used are debugger tool, git etc. When building the project first I worked with the HTML and made the main frame of the page, than I continued building the smaller features and styling them.
For my project I used HTML, CSS and didn't include frameworks like Bootstrap. If I had more time I would try to implement hamburger menu.
