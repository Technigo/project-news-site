# News Site
The assignment we got was to make a news site regarding whatever we wanted. Since I love food I chose that as my subject.
We should make the site responsive so it looks good on both mobile, tablet and desktop.


## The problem
I started with testing around a bit in the beginning. After a while I felt the need to do a sketch so I drawed one really quick. I found flexbox really hard to understand and have been quite stressed about it all week. Couldn't really understand when I should use what and why and how the different boxes applies. 

I decided to try CSS-grid instead and found that much more easy to grasp. I'm glad i coded for mobile first and then tablet and desktop. I'm also glad I managed to do the logo for "Yummy" myself, that was fun! If I had more time (well I have but I feel like I really need the weekend off to rest and gain some new energy:) I would have focused on adding a footer, box shadow and put more time into the design and styling since I find that very funny.
