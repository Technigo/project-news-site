# News Site

This was the first project I did at the Technigo Coding Bootcamp. The focus of the assignment was to create a news site with a responsive layout for desktop, tablet and mobile screens using Flexbox. 

## The problem

I started with the creation of the HTML structure of the site. Thereafter I continued with the CSS styling for the mobile screen size, using Flexbox to create the layout of the page. I wrote media queries for screen sizes over 667px and 1024px respectively so that the site would be easy to read, aesthetically pleasing and understandable for all screen sizes. If I had more time I would go over the CSS and clean it up a little more, I would also change the design of the page to make it less basic and add a more modern feeling to it.
