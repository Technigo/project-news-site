        <p>
          Though they often frequent cold, coastal waters, orcas can be found from the polar regions to the Equator.
          They're at the top of the food chain and have very diverse diets, feasting on fish, penguins, and marine
          mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales, employing teeth that can be four inches long. They are
          known to grab seals right off the ice. They also eat fish, squid, and <a

        <p>

          The Swedish coastguard got a pleasant surprise on Thursday when a group of killer whales were spotted
          swimming alongside a patrol boat on the west coast. The killer whales were spotted a hundred metres from the
          boat, which was patrolling the waters of Bohus. Finally, the pack of whales swam next to the boat. According
          to the crew, it seemed that they were in playful mood and swam back and forth under the boat, and then
          jumped up in front. The largest was said to be about five to six meters long, and the smallest was about
          three meters long and looked to be a <a href="https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/6242751">calf</a>.

        <h6> <a href="#">Why are orcas called 'killer whales' when they are dolphins?
          </a></h6>
        <p>
          Dolphins and whales are closely related. Orcas were given the name killer whale by ancient sailors
          observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species. They called orcas ballena
          asesina, or whale killer, a term that was eventually flipped around to the easier killer whale. Their
          Latin name, Orcinus orca, also reflects this observation of orcas feeding on large whales. Orcinus
          translates to of the kingdom of the dead, and orca refers to a kind of whale. We know that orcas are top
          predators, yes, but not the vicious whale killers that the ancient mariners thought them to be. If you
          could give orcas another name, what would you call<a

        <h7> <a href="#">How do orcas communicate?
          </a></h7>
        <p>
          In orca populations, knowledge is passed down to younger individuals from their elders,what to eat and
          were to find it, how to catch it, who to avoid, vocalisations and calls unique to pods and family groups,
          and the distinct accent of the population. Having multiple prey items to choose from probably led to the
          niche specialisations we see today, millions of year ago, different groups started eating different things
          to avoid competing for the same food. Now these groups are genetically different, in addition to their
          unique appearance and <a href="https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-orcas/">cultures.</a>

          </a></h8>
        <p>
          Orcas sleep in a very different way to humans. We have a breathing reflex and when we sleep or become
          unconscious, we continue to breath automatically. Orcas cannot sleep in this way, they have to remain
          conscious, even when they are sleeping! This is because their breathing is not automatic - they have to
          actively decide when to breath, and so they must be conscious even when sleeping. If like us, orcas went
          into a deep unconscious sleep, they would stop breathing and suffocate or <a

        <p>
          Orcas worldwide face a number of threats. They get caught in fishing nets and gear accidentally, face
          problems with toxic waste and pollution in the sea. Increase in boat traffic can result in collisions with
          orcas and an increase in underwater noise
