# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site whit some basic headlines and navigator that's responsive. I desided to base my news site on Lego and chose some articels on the theme. 

## The problem
Well i started to watch the material sent to us and googeld some. I had a hard time grasping it all and wraping my head around everything, so i also askt a friend for some tips. I wanted to do it all by my self, but sometimes I guess it's better to ask for help than just feeling stuck and overwhelmed. I tried and tried and faild alot, but in the end I grasped some and got thru it. And after getting some help, I also got a better understanding for what I read on w3schools for example. 
I had an idea in my head and I used figjam a bit, otherwise I didnt really plan - more try and see how it goes. 
If i had more time i would create more articles, fix the photos proportion and working more on the layout and navbar.
