        <h2>The Princess cake</h2>
        <p>The so called Princess cake has become popular all over the world. The cake is a
          traditional Swedish layer cake or torte consisting of alternating layers of airy sponge cake,
          pastry cream, and a thick-domed layer of whipped cream. The cake is covered by a layer of rolled marzipan,
          giving it a smooth, rounded top. </p>
        <p>
          The marzipan overlay is usually green, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and
          often decorated with a pink marzipan rose. While the original recipe did not contain any fruit, modern
          versions
          usually include layers of jam or fresh fruit, usually raspberries.</p>
