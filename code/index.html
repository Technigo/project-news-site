          <p>July was the world's hottest month ever recorded, a US federal scientific and regulatory agency has reported.

            The data shows that the combined land and ocean-surface temperature was 0.93C (1.68F) above the 20th Century average of 15.8C (60.4F).
          
            It is the highest temperature since record-keeping began 142 years ago. The previous record, set in July 2016, was equalled in 2019 and 2020.
          
            Experts believe this is due to the long-term impact of climate change.</p>
          
          <p>In a statement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that July's "unenviable distinction" was a cause for concern.
          
            "In this case, first place is the worst place to be," NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement.
          
            "This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe."
          
            The combined land and ocean-surface temperature was 0.01C higher than the 2016 record.
          
            In the Northern Hemisphere, land-surface temperature reached an "unprecedented" 1.54C higher than average, surpassing a previous record set in 2012.

        <h3>Why does the fox communicate?</h3>
        <p>It may be for a male to find a female from a breeding standpoint. It may be a pack nature or a family type group where 
          they’re trying to communicate and find out from a social aspect or to find food. But there’s a number of vocalizations they make.</p></a>

        <h3>Should we give up flying for the sake of the climate?</h3>
        <p>Everything we do, from the food we eat, products we buy to the way we travel, releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and so has an impact on the planet’s climate. But some activities have a far greater impact than others.
          Around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions come from aviation.</p></a>

        <h3>A climate solution is hidden in the hedgerows</h3>
        <p>Hedgerows are hugely important but often taken for granted.  Hedgerows help slow down the runoff of water, guarding against flooding and soil erosion, and act as barriers to help prevent 
          pesticide and fertiliser pollution getting into water supplies. Studies show they can improve the quality of air by helping trap air pollution.</p></a>

        <h3>Why cold weather doesn’t mean climate change is fake</h3>
        <p> In a time when climate change is discussed in the context of record highs, droughts, and wildfires, cold weather and blizzards can seem out of place. 
          For those who deny that climate change is happening, it's an opportunity to undermine scientific consensus.</p></a>
