      <p class="text">Brexit day is fast approaching, with the UK on track to officially leave the European Union (EU)
        in just a few
        weeks time. But how did we get to this stage and what is in the Brexit deal?
        Here is everything you need to know about the UK's departure, including what the deal means for UK citizens and
        the changes to travel, investments and savings we can expect to see post-Brexit.

      <p>A Step-by-Step Guide to Trump’s Impeachment Trial</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          WASHINGTON — The House intends to vote this week to send its articles of impeachment against President Trump
          to the Senate, prompting only the third impeachment trial of a president in American history.
          The vote will put to rest nearly a month of uncertainty over when a trial might begin and quickly turn over to
          the Senate a historic debate over whether Mr. Trump committed what the Constitution describes as “high crimes
          and misdemeanors.”
          The Republican-led Senate is all but certain to vote eventually to acquit Mr. Trump. But the path forward
          remains murky, with few historical precedents and scant constitutional guidance to light the way. While
          decades-old congressional rules will be dusted off in the coming days, other, potentially grave decisions that
          could color the outcome of the trial will be settled on the fly.
          Here is how we expect things to play out on Capitol Hill in the coming days and weeks.</p>
