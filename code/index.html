      <h2>Stockholm Syndrome</h2>
      <p class="big-news-text"> Carl Kostyál opened his second exhibition “Stockholm Syndrome” at Hospitalet in Stockholm this Monday. After the succé show “Stockholm Sessions” (07.05.2021 - 30.05.2021) which included pieces by varios modern artist, they chose tho concent on only two artists this time Oli Epp and Ry David Bradley.   
          Oli Epp’s paintings circulate a number of themes to do with the tragicomic element of living in the 21st century society, dealing with the complexity of identity and anxieties living in the digital age; consumerism and consumption which leads to control and addiction, anxiety and conflict. The paintings work in an endlessly cyclical way of Epp ironically questioning idealisms and our pursuit of perfection and the conflict that arises as a result.
           Ry David Bradley continues a longstanding investigation of the 21st century painting. High contrast renders are achieved through a process of heating dyes onto the textured surface of suede, adding a layer of spray paint cast over the digital source. Rich hues often unobtainable by anything but the chromatic intensity of a screen, or of paint itself, sit alongside both of these in a process Bradley has slowly developed over many years of investigation.
