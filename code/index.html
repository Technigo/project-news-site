        <p class="special-font">Margot Robbie, the 33-year old four time winner Golden Globe Award actress sure is T H E
          perfect actress to play Barbie. Her beauty, her smile, her talent fits perfect for the role but since this
          project is not about writing real articles I will just fill this out with some gibberish. <br><br />
          By now most of you have probably already stopped reading but if not I can tell you that summer is here (no
          sh*t Sherlock) so dont forget to wear sunscreen! But if you by any chance made it THIS far, congrats to you!!
          Fun surprise to know this was not all about Barbie, right?
          <br><br />
          Anyway, Barbie Barbie Barbie. Can't wait to see it. Good premiere-date: july 21s, AKA my biiirthday!
