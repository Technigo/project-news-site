          <h1>A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally dependent on their mother for survival. </h1>
          <p>They do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.</p>

              Guinea pig, (Cavia porcellus), a domesticated species of South American rodent belonging to the cavy family (Caviidae).
            </h1>
            <p>
              It resembles other cavies in having a robust body with short limbs, large head and eyes, and short ears. The feet have hairless soles and short sharp claws. There are four toes on the forefeet and three on the hind feet. Several breeds of domesticated guinea pigs exist, which are sometimes grouped by coat texture and hair length. The term guinea pig is also used colloquially to refer to a person who serves as a test subject in an experiment.
