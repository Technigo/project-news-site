          		differs not only by traditions and customs but also by a day of the holidays. Nowadays for the sake of convinience there is a standartization of time around the world, so we do celebrate the new year on the 1st of January. Fortunately local traditions are alive and they are related to the religious and cultural heritage. That is why in some places new year is coming in winter, in some places in spring and in some it never comes.
