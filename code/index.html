       <h3>The world needs more women engineers</h3>
        <p>According to a recent World Economic Forum report, the share of women in computer and mathematical jobs is 23%, and a mere 11% in architecture and engineering jobs. However, women engineers are making some waves in this field against all odds.</p>
       <p>For centuries, women have played an essential role as designers and builders of critical structures and machines even before the term ‘engineer’ was coined in the 11th century. However, fields, such as engineering, have been largely kept shut from women. Upon the establishment of educational institutions, most universities didn’t admit women until the early 1800s. But this has never deterred women from participating in the engineering sector. In 1876, Elizabeth Bragg, unfettered by the gender disparities and discrimination, became the first female recipient of an engineering degree when she got her bachelor’s in civil engineering from the University of Berkeley, paving the way for thousands of women of the 19th century who followed her lead. It wasn’t until the World War II that serious attention was paid to women’s education in technical fields. Even in the 21st century, STEM continues to be dominated by men. With the gruesome gender gap and hiring discrimination, women continue to endure struggles in this field.</p>

        <h3>How Femtech Moves From Niche To Essential</h3>
        <p>Women hold up half the sky. Yet the technology supporting women’s health is still not where it should be in terms of being perceived as an essential or gaining equal investors’ attention.
           According to Crunchbase data, 2021 was a special year for femtech as global venture funding in the segment crossed the $1.2 billion mark for the first time.
           Maven Clinic raised $110 million and reached unicorn status, Elvie raised $87 million, and Flo Health raised $50 million—all in just the last few months, demonstrating the success stories the industry is craving.</p>
