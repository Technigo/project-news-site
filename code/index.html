        <h3>New Wind Farm in Stockholm</h3>
        <p>
          New wind farm is planned to be set up just outside of Stockholm. 
          We urge everyone to keep up with the construction and find new way to fly 
          when flying through the south of the city. Our reporters haven’t yet found out 
          the exact date for building to commence. As soon as we have the information 
          we will post it.  
        </p>

      <h4>Staying for christmas?</h4>
      <p>
        For all of you staying with us this winter it's time to start prepping.
        Bulking season is here. Summer is over and with that beach season. 
        So start to eat as much as possible. That extra fat will be useful when 
        the cold is here and food is limited. Don’t worry about beach 2022, 
        that extra fat will be gone by march and you will regret that you didn’t eat 
        even more during the fall. Remember, a fat winter bird is a happy winter bird!

      <h4>Local news</h4>
      <p>
        Our reporter covering the community council has yet to report anything. 
        Aside from the wind farm not much seem to be up with the hoomans. 
        The amount of them moving around has thou increased in the last weeks. 
        So hopefully there will be more food for us city birds in trash bins. 
        And you country birds will hopefully be more left alone on the countryside 
        as more hoomans seem to return to the city.
