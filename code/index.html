            <h2>Epic climate agreement signed&#128293;</h2>
            <p>In case you missed it: COP15 came to a happy end when negotiators reached a historic deal just before Christmas last year, at a U.N. biodiversity conference in Montreal. It is a huge landmark for those fighting to protecting our lands and oceans. 
              "We can truly be proud" said Chinese Environment Minister Huang Runqiu, “We have in our hands a package which I think can guide us as we all work together to halt and reverse biodiversity loss and put biodiversity on the path to recovery for the benefit of all people in the world”.</p>
