      <h2 class="section-title">BREAKING: A WILD CHASE IN THE HEAT!</h2>
      <h4>Published 31/7/2023 16:44</h4>
      <p class="main-news"><img src="odettechase.jpg" alt="Odette after the chase." width="200px">
        She has done it again, folks. Looking at 11-year-old Odette and her daily antics, you would not guess how fast this Jack-Cairn lady can run when given the chance.<br/><br/>
        This dog doesn't particularly enjoy excercise - except when there's an element of chase tied to it", a source tells Terrier Times. On Monday the 31st of July, Odette managed to wiggle herself out of her harness during her afternoon walk.<br/><br/>
        She was chased around the neighbourhood for almost two hours before getting caught.
        The day was quite hot, and as Odette has quite a thick fur, she tired herself out eventually and gave the worried search party a chance to get her to safety. An adventure like this could be quite dangerous for and old dog with a thick fur.
        "Her heart was beating quite fast for a while there, but luckily it calmed down after a while", the owner says wth relief.<br/><br/>
