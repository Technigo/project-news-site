          </div>  
          <p> With it's big and lovely leaves it can make any room
             feel like a small jungle. 
             Monsteras appreciate a warm, humid environment, a good amount of water and gentle sunlight. 
             Place your Monstera where it can receive medium to bright indirect light. Rotate your Monstera 
             periodically to ensure even growth on all sides and dust the leaves often so the plant can photosynthesize efficiently.

            <h4>Pancake plant</h4>
            </div>
           <p> This a low maintenance plant that thrives in a bright spot near a window, but it is best to keep the 
             plant out of direct sunlight as too much direct sun can cause the leaves to burn. 
             However, too little light can cause the leaves to fade and the plant's overall health to suffer, 
             so take time to find a spot that's just right.
             It's important to let the pancake plants soil dry between waterings, when the leaves start to look tad droopy 
             it's time for ad little drink.</p>

            <h4>Ficus Elastica</h4>
          </div>
            <p> Ficus Elastica or Rubber Tree belongs to the species of fig trees from which there are more than 1.000 kinds
              and this plant is being loved for its sturdiness and is made for beginners in the gardening world! 
              Place your Ficus in a location where it can receive bright, indirect light. 
              Too much direct sun will scorch the leaves, but this plant will not fare well in low light spaces.
              It does tolerate dry room air, but since it’s a tropical tree it prefers a moist and warm climate, 
              that’s why it should be sprayed with water from time to time.
