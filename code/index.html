       <h1>The heuristics of Neurodesign</h1>
       <p>Exactly how the mind works is still largely a mystery. And as with most mysteries, there are clues that give resolution to the interworking of how we think. How we think involves a swarm of highly interrelated mental processes including attention, memory, and thinking.</p>

    <h2><a href="./article1.html">What is Web 3.0?</a></h2> 
    
    <h3>Over 30 years Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, also known as the WWW.
      Imagine a new type of internet that not only accurately interprets what 
      you input, but actually understands everything you convey, whether through text,
      voice or other media, one where all content you consume is more tailored to you 
      than ever before.</h3> 

    <p>One that gives you full privacy controls over the data you share with 
       other parties, allows you to earn money if you provide it to advertisers
       or interact with certain applications, and remains free from draconian 
       third-party censorship. </p>

    <h2><a href="./article2.html">Spotify’s Embodiment of Emotional Design</a></h2>

    <h3>Statistic states that as of the first quarter of 2022, Spotify had 
      182 million subscribers worldwide, up from 158 million in the 
      corresponding quarter of 2021. Spotify's subscriber base increased in the 
      last few years and has doubled.</h3> 

    <img src="./images/image3.jpg" width="250px">

    <p>Something that stands out in particular about Spotify’s overall experience 
      is its focus on personalisation, which can be drawn from a practice called 
      Emotional Design. Spotify utilises positive emotional triggers throughout 
      their product to delight users.</p>

      <h2><a href="./article3.html">When AI can make art, what does it mean for creativity?</a></h2>

      <h3>Image-generators such as Dall-E 2 can produce pictures on any theme you wish 
        for in seconds. Some creatives are alarmed but others are sceptical of the 
        hype.</h3> 

      <p>The domestic proliferation of TV after World War II drew audiences away from
         theaters and in the process helped dismantle the old studio system. The “digital
          revolution” has recalibrated where, when, and how we watch, even as it has caused
           cinephiles to mourn the loss of celluloid. Media says that cinema is under threat.</p>

        <h3>Swoosh members will compete to create digital kicks with the brand’s
           design staff and bag a royalty cut. But not even Nike knows how it’s 
           going to work.</h3> 

        <img src="./images/image5.jpg" width="250px">

        <p>Swoosh exists on a domain named “.nike” and will be a digital space for
           registered members. It’s currently in beta, and registration to join opens 
           in May. The platform will initially focus on community building and present
           members with “challenges” to get a sense of what they want to see. The 
           brand’s first virtual collection will launch in August 2023 shaped through 
          interactive voting.</p>
