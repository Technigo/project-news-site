          <h1>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve no doubt felt the orange wine crush.
             For the past few years, they’ve become the darling of the wine-professional circuit, creeping onto wine menus.
              Not quite white wine, not quite red, and somewhat akin to rose,
             orange wine sits within its own category. And while many have been open
             to tasting orange wine, not everyone may know exactly what it is. In 
            short, it’s all about the skins. But, if you’re curious to know more, 
            we’ve got a handy primer for you. </h1>

                  <h3 class="card__heading">How orange wine is made</h3>
                  <p class="card__category">The simplest explanation is that orange wine is made from white grapes
                    using the same process used to make red wine. Traditionally, white wines 
                    are made from white grapes pressed immediately after harvest to remove the
                     juice from the grape cluster’s skins, seeds, and stems. 
                     This yields a clear liquid to ferment into white wine</p>

                  <h3 class="card__heading">The history of orange wine</h3>
                  <p class="card__category">Though orange wine has seen an epic rise in popularity in
                    recent years, there’s nothing new about this style of wine. Its origins are ancient — as in, it’s been produced for millennia.
                    Archeological evidence shows that it was made as far back as 6000 B.C. in what is now the modern-day country of Georgia.</p>

                  <h3 class="card__heading">Orange wine worldwide</h3>
                  <p class="card__category">But other forms were found during the Roman empire. The Romans used clay pots,
                     or amphorae, to transport wine to regions such as Alentejo, Portugal,
                      where the practice remains a central part of the winemaking tradition. Though much of
                     the amphora or ”tahla” wine is red, many producers, such as Herdade do
                      Rocim and Adega Cartuxa, also make a version of white, skin-contact wine.</p>

                  <p class="card__category">Because orange wine is made using a wide range of grape varieties and at
                     different temperatures in different climates, the diversity within this style is vast.</p>

                  <p class="card__category">Orange wines are typically dry with hints of tannin and a weightier mouthfeel.
                     More robust than white wine but with less intensity than bold, tannic reds, this style is a
                      perfect match for a variety of cuisines.</p>

                  <h3 class="card__heading">Concept of orange wine </h3>
                  <p class="card__category">The concept of orange wine is rooted in imparting the same structural
                     characteristics to white wine as in red wine. To achieve this,
                      white grape juice is left in contact with the skins during fermentation.
                       This can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of years, depending on where it is produced.
                        The result is a white wine with a bit more structure and complexity.</p>

                  <h3 class="card__heading">So why is it called orange wine?</h3>
                  <p class="card__category">Contrary to what the name might infer, there aren’t actually
                     any oranges involved in the winemaking process. The name comes instead from the slightly orange,
                      amber, rosy color the wine takes on.</p>
