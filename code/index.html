        <p>Polar stratospheric clouds: nacreous</p>
        <p class="content">Polar stratospheric clouds composed primarily of ice are known as nacreous, or
          mother-of-pearl, clouds. After sunset they are characterized by brilliant iridescent colours, as shown in this
          photograph from Sweden.</p>
        <p class="content">Nacreous clouds only form in the stratosphere at a temperature below the ice frost point
          (typically near –85 °C) in the high latitudes of both hemispheres during the winter. They are often lenticular
          in shape.</p>

            formations, arranged parallel to the flow of the air), fibrous or uniform appearance, totally or partly
            covering the sky, and having parts thin enough to reveal the Sun at least vaguely, as through ground glass

            huge towers. At least part of its upper portion is usually smooth, or fibrous or striated, and nearly always
            flattened; this part often spreads out in the shape of an anvil or vast plume.</p>
          <p>Under the base of this cloud, which is often very dark, there are frequently low ragged clouds either
