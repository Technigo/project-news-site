          <h1>The AI-Fueled Future of Work Needs Humans More Than Ever</h1>
          <p>
            Much like the internet did in the 1990s, AI is going to change the very definition of work. While change can
            be scary, if the last three years taught us anything, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent how we do
            things. I believe the best way to manage the changes ahead for employees and employers alike is to adopt a
            skills-first mindset.As for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based
            approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of
            AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly
            developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI
            have seen 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of
            the technology. The leaders that focus on these skills when hiring (rather than just the degree someone has
            earned or jobs they’ve had) will unlock more potential and be more agile as the way we do work continues to
            change.
