      <p class="other-news-text">Balasana is a resting pose. Stay anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. Beginners can also use Balasana to get a taste of a deep forward bend, where the torso rests on the thighs. Stay in the pose from 1 to 3 minutes. To come up, first lengthen the front torso, and then with an inhalation lift from the tailbone as it presses down and into the pelvis.

        Corpse pose is traditionally practiced at the end of a yoga sequence. It can however be used at the beginning to calm the body before practice or in the middle of a sequence to rest. When used at the end of a yoga practice it is traditionally followed by a seated meditation period to re-integrate the body-mind-spirit back into the world.

      <img class="other-news-image" src="images/dove.png" alt="Pigeon Pose"/>
      <p class="other-news-text">
        Pigeon pose specifically works as a hip opener and forward bend, stretching your thighs, groin, back, piriformis, and psoas. The leg extended to the rear gets a stretch of the psoas and other hip flexors.3 On the other side, the rotators and outer hip are stretched. It is a good antidote to sitting for long periods. It prepares you for seated postures and backbends.

        Cow Face Pose (Gomukhasana) stretches the upper arms, back muscles, glutes and outer thighs.
Alignment Insights: Gomukhasana is often uncomfortable at first because it gets into all kinds of places that are hard to stretch. Props can help! Consider taking a folded blanket under your seat and have a strap handy for the arm bind.
