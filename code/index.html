                <h1>The heuristics of Neurodesign</h1>
                <p> Exactly how the mind works is still largely a mystery. 
                    And as with most mysteries, there are clues that give resolution 
                    to the interworking of how we think. How we think involves a swarm 
                    of highly interrelated mental processes including attention, memory,
                    and thinking.

                <h3 class="article-intro"> Over 30 years Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.
                  Imagine a new type of internet that not only accurately interprets what 
                  you input, but understands everything you convey,
                  voice or other media, one where all content you consume is more tailored to you.</h3>

                <p class="article-intro">Something that stands out in particular about Spotify‚Äôs overall experience 
                    is its focus on personalisation, which can be drawn from a practice called 
                    Emotional Design. Spotify utilises positive emotional triggers throughout 
                    their product to delight users based on a user‚Äôs tracks.</p>
