                    Ribollita (Tuscan Ribollita) is a warm and hearty first
                    course typical of poor Tuscan cuisine: it is a soup of stale
                    bread and vegetables whose main ingredients are black
                    cabbage, savoy cabbage and beans.

                  <p>
                    According to peasant tradition, it was prepared on Fridays,
                    the lean day, by putting together the leftovers from the
                    previous day and then simmered several times over a low
                    fire; first with vegetables alone, then with the addition of
                    hard bread, hence the name "ribollita" : the more it is
                    cooked, the better it gets for the following days!

                    Cantucci (Cantuccini) also known as "Biscotti di Prato" are
                    typical sweets of traditional Tuscan cuisine : these are dry
                    almond cookies, which are made by slicing strands of dough
                    while still warm and then baked again a few minutes, where
                    the Tozzetti will take on a rustic and slightly golden

                    Tuscan liver crostini represent one of the most celebrated
                    and beloved dishes of regional cuisine. These delicious
                    appetizers are made with chicken livers, crispy Tuscan bread
                    and a selection of ingredients that combine perfectly to
                    create a unique flavor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The origin of Tuscan liver crostini goes back a long way and
                    is rooted in the region's peasant tradition. During the
                    Middle Ages, the noble classes could afford to consume
                    animal liver, which was considered a valuable food.
                    Peasants, on the other hand, used less noble parts of the
                    animal, such as the liver, to avoid waste. To make crostini,
                    Tuscan peasants would cook the liver in a pan with garlic,
                    sage, butter and other flavorings until it was soft and
                    tasty. Afterwards, they would spread the liver cream on
                    toasted Tuscan bread, thus creating Tuscan liver crostini.

                    Panforte is a Christmas cake typical of the city of Siena
                    and the Tuscan tradition. It is a low bread made with
                    almonds, candied fruit, sugar and honey enriched with
                    spices, then baked in the oven on a sheet of wafer; where it
                    will take on a soft to crispy texture and the unmistakable
                    pungent scent and honeyed taste! A unique treat that has
                    medieval origins.

                  <p>
                    In its ancient version it was prepared in monasteries and
                    was a similar flatbread made with water, honey and fresh
                    fruit ; which after a few days of fermentation turned into a
                    sour bread precisely "panes fortis." It was in 1550, that
                    Sister Berta, to refresh the Sienese fighters after a siege,
                    enriched the recipe with candied fruit, almonds and spices,
                    giving the cake the flavor we all know today!

                    Cavallucci are exquisite sweets, typical of Tuscan pastries,

                    they take on the appearance of round cookies, slightly

                    In short, a real goodness that has distant origins; already
                    in the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent they were sold in
                    taverns and consumed by drivers on horseback, hence the name
                    cavallucci. Today they have become traditional of the
                    Christmas season along with Cantucci and Ricciarelli.

                    Pappa al pomodoro is a poor first course typical of Tuscan
                    peasant cuisine; based on stale Tuscan unsalted bread,
                    slowly cooked in peeled tomatoes, vegetable broth, basil,
                    extra virgin olive oil; where all the ingredients blend

                    Gnudi are a typical first course of Tuscan cuisine,

                    elongated-shaped gnocchi made with ricotta, spinach, and
                    parmesan cheese. From the Tuscan dialect they are called

                    pasta sheet typical of Ravioli, so they are made exclusively
                    with the contents of the filling!

                    Fagioli all'uccelletto are a rich and hearty vegetarian side
                    dish, typical of poor Tuscan cuisine; made with cannellini
                    beans, tomato puree, garlic, oil and sage leaves; which
                    cooked slowly together, result in a warm, comforting and
                    juicy terrine; a goodness that has its roots in peasant
                    tradition; when not being able to afford meat, they cooked
                    beans with the same flavors as fowl and game; that's why
                    they are called Fagioli all'uccelletto .

                    Ideal for pairing with main courses of all kinds, such as
                    Pork Loin and Beer Chicken ; they are also perfect as a main
                    course, accompanied by homemade bread or slices of Focaccia
                    or some tasty Polenta!
