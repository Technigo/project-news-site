       <h1>Spotify’s Embodiment of Emotional Design</h1>

       <h3> On average, each smartphone user has 80+ apps on a phone, but only really launch around 9 apps daily. One app that myself and others use to cater to our music-streaming and podcast-binging needs is Spotify.
       </h3>

        <p> In fact, Statistic states that as of the first quarter of 2022, Spotify had 182 million premium subscribers worldwide, up from 158 million in the corresponding quarter of 2021. Spotify’s subscriber base has increased in the last few years and has doubled since early 2017.
            Something that stands out in particular about Spotify’s overall experience is its focus on personalisation, which can be drawn from a practice called Emotional Design. Spotify utilises positive emotional triggers throughout their product to delight users, like their custom mixes based on a user’s recently listened-to tracks.
            Personalisation results in an emotional user experience, which is key to driving app engagement. One of the main reasons why most app users churn within just 90 days is due to disengagement. So it is clear to see how important it is to provide fresh, personalised, regular content to customers.
            In this article, we will discuss how emotional design plays a key factor in Spotify’s iconic, personalised experience, and what we can learn from it.
