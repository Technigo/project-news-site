        <h3> On average, each smartphone user has 80+ apps on a phone, but only really launch around 9 apps daily. One app that myself and others use to cater to our music-streaming and podcast-binging needs is Spotify.

         <p> One that gives you full privacy controls over the data you share with other parties, allows you to earn money if you provide it to advertisers or interact with certain applications, and remains free from draconian third-party censorship. Over 30 years Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, also known as the WWW. Now that acronym might as well stand for What Went Wrong? The early internet was founded on the utopian values of equality, transparency and information access and promised to deliver to the world. Instead, it created global behemoths like Google (now under Alphabet), Facebook (now Meta), Uber, Amazon and other Web2 giants that arguably turned its users into its products, wielding their private data as they saw fit to keep profits coming. Countless shocking scandals have emerged over the last few years (see Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica debacle) exposing how Big Tech has been using the internet as a giant psychological lab to extract the maximum value out of its unsuspecting subjects.</p>
