       <h1>Nike Will Design Sneakers for the Metaverse</h1>

       <h3> Swoosh members will compete to create digital kicks with the brand’s design staff and 
        bag a royalty cut. But not even Nike knows how it’s going to work.
       </h3>

        <img src="./images/image5.jpg" alt="Article design" width="950px"> 
        <p>Swoosh exists on a domain named “.nike” and will be a digital space for registered members. 
        It’s currently in beta, and registration to join opens in May. The platform will initially 
        focus on community building and present members with “challenges” to get a sense of what 
        they want to see. The brand’s first virtual collection will launch in August 2023 shaped 
        through interactive voting. Virtual clothing from brands is nothing new, but Nike has 
        teased that Swoosh’s community challenges will expand next year to include competitions
        in which members can win a chance to codesign virtual Nike products with the brand’s 
        designers and earn a percentage of royalties.But before would-be sneaker designers get too
        excited, details on just how this creator economy will work—the selection process, how 
        design collaborations will take place, what percentage of revenue will people receive, 
        what legal frameworks will be in place to ensure codesigners get paid—are extremely vague.
