       <h1>What is Web 3.0?</h1>

       <h3> Imagine a new type of internet that not only accurately interprets what
         you input, but actually understands everything you convey, whether through 
         text, voice or other media, one where all content you consume is more tailored
          to you than ever before. 
       </h3>

        <img src="./images/image4.jpg" alt="Article design" width="950px"> 

        <p> One that gives you full privacy controls over the data you share with other
             parties, allows you to earn money if you provide it to advertisers or 
             interact with certain applications, and remains free from draconian 
             third-party censorship. Over 30 years Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, also known as the WWW. Now that acronym might as well stand for What Went Wrong?
             The early internet was founded on the utopian values of equality, transparency and information access and promised to deliver to the world. Instead, it created global behemoths like Google (now under Alphabet), Facebook (now Meta), Uber, Amazon and other Web2 giants that arguably turned its users into its products, wielding their private data as they saw fit to keep profits coming.
             
    
             Countless shocking scandals have emerged over the last few years 
             (see Facebookâ€™s Cambridge Analytica debacle) exposing how Big Tech has
             been using the internet as a giant psychological lab to extract the maximum
             value out of its unsuspecting subjects.
