# News Site

My newsite is about plants, because I love plants. 

## The problem

I had some problems with the tags, I was getting lost and forget to close some tags, and hence the outcom was not as I wished. So I went throug it again.

Anothe issue I had with the pictures. I wasn´t able to manipulate the size in CSS so I decide to do it in HTML.

I wanted to make some nice caption but for some reason, it didn´t worked. When I was trying the same language in Code Pen, there it was working but not here. So I gave up on it. 

I used a lot CodePen as a side project where I can test out things. 

If I would have more time and patience, probably I would work more on getting the design I want it with the some extra features.
