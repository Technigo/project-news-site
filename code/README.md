# News Site

The assignment was to build a news site. I have built a news site about interior design.

## The problem

I started with researching flexbox and grid. I also searched for inspiration for colors, fonts and pictures for the site. I used the resources page on Notion, looked up a few questions on Stackoverflow but also googled alot. To get a hang of planning the project and the week I have tried a few different tools, such as todolists, jamboard etc. 

If I had more time I would have started with learning how to do a hamburger menu. Because I realised I wanted one when I was half way through all of my coding and did not feel confident enough to go back.
