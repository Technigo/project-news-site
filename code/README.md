# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site with a main article at the top, and smaller articles below. There should be 4 columns of sub-articles on a desktop screen, 2 columns on a tablet, and 1 column on a mobile.

## The problem

I had an idea of wanting to create something fun and interactive, that revealed itself as you hovered over elements. Little did I know, :hover doesn't work very well on mobile. I planned with a simple sketch, and then started working on the desktop version first. This was a mistake - I should have started with mobile, and then worked my way to desktop. But it was a good learning experience.

I used a combination of flex and grid, as well as transitions and :hover. I also used clamp() for font sizes, and media queries. I used FontAwesome for icons and logos, and GoogleFonts for fonts.

If I had more time, I would start by designing a mobile-first site (minimalist this time), and work my way to the desktop version using @media.
