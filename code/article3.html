       <h1>When AI can make art, what does it mean for creativity?</h1>

       <h3> Image-generators such as Dall-E 2 can produce pictures on any theme you wish for 
        in seconds. Some creatives are alarmed but others are sceptical of the hype.

        <p> The domestic proliferation of TV after World War II drew audiences away from
             theaters and in the process helped dismantle the old studio system. The “digital 
             revolution” has recalibrated where, when, and how we watch, even as it has caused 
             cinephiles to mourn the loss of celluloid. Media says that cinema is under threat.
             Synthetic media rely on machine learning tools that perform a range of tasks. They enable micro-targeted systems of distribution; streamline production and post-production workflows; and animate, edit, or even create entire audiovisual works from a text prompt.

            Many of the hazards of synthetic media, such as malicious deepfakes, have been well 
            documented and need further attention. Still, AI elicits a special kind of anxiety 
            for the film and TV industry’s creative classes. The question now on everyone’s mind
            is whether feature-length films made by text-to-video generators will eliminate 
            the skilled labor of screenwriters, graphic artists, editors, and directors.
