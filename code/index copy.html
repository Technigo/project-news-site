            Guinea pig, (Cavia porcellus), a domesticated species of South American rodent belonging to the cavy family (Caviidae).
          </h1>
          <p>
            It resembles other cavies in having a robust body with short limbs, large head and eyes, and short ears. The feet have hairless soles and short sharp claws. There are four toes on the forefeet and three on the hind feet. Several breeds of domesticated guinea pigs exist, which are sometimes grouped by coat texture and hair length. The term guinea pig is also used colloquially to refer to a person who serves as a test subject in an experiment.
