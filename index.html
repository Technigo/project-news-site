    <p class="big-news-text">On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three
      ships. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands. There he restocked provisions and made repairs then departed
      from San Sebastián de La Gomera on 6 September, for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean. <a

    <p class="small-news-text b">A monk named Dionysius Exiguus creates this new dating system as part of his efforts to
      understand the dating of Easter. It wanted the year 1 AD to be the date when Jesus Christ was born, although later
      calculations show that his birth occurred before this. Gradually use of this calendar became more widespread, and
      is now the most widely accepted system for counting years in the world. <a href="#" class="read-more">Read

    <p class="small-news-text d">Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand’s love story is the stuff romance novels are made of.
      Because they were married in secret, Isabella was denied her right to the throne of Castile. From this came the
      war over the succession of the Castillian throne. Isabella emerged victorious, and because of her marriage to King
      Ferdinand of Aragon, their kingdoms merged into a powerful and unified empire, and their reign was known for
      encouraging expeditions, including Christopher Columbus’s trip to what would later be known as the Americas. <a
